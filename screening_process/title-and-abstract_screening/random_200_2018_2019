  abstract                   = {{The Almeria-Oran Front (AOF) is a recognised hotspot of genetic
   differentiation in the sea, with genetic discontinuities reported in
   more than 50 species. The AOF is a barrier to dispersal and an
   ecological boundary; both can determine the position of these genetic
   breaks. However, the maintenance of genetic differentiation is likely
   reinforced by genetic barriers. A general drawback of previous studies
   is an insufficient density of sampling sites at the transition zone,
   with a conspicuous lack of samples from the southern coastline. We
   analysed the fine-scale genetic structure in the mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis using a few ancestry-informative loci previously
   identified from genome scans. We discovered a 600-km-wide mosaic hybrid
   zone eastward of the AOF along the Algerian coasts. This mosaic zone
   provides a new twist to our understanding of the Atlantic-Mediterranean
   transition because it demonstrates that the two lineages can live in
   sympatry with ample opportunities to interbreed in a large area, but
   they hardly do so. This implies that some form of reproductive isolation
   must exist to maintain the two genetic backgrounds locally cohesive. The
   mosaic zone ends with an abrupt genetic shift at a barrier to dispersal
   in the Gulf of Bejaia, Eastern Algeria. Simulations of endogenous or
   exogenous selection in models that account for the geography and
   hydrodynamic features of the region support the hypothesis that sister
   hybrid zones could have been differentially trapped at two alternative
   barriers to dispersal and/or environmental boundaries, at Almeria in the
   north and Bejaia in the south. A preponderantly unidirectional
   north-south gene flow next to the AOF can also maintain a patch of
   intrinsically maintained genetic background in the south and the mosaic
   structure, even in the absence of local adaptation. Our results concur
   with the coupling hypothesis that suggests that natural barriers can
   explain the position of genetic breaks, while their maintenance depends
   on genetic barriers.}},

   application. A total of 1321 trees, representing 37 full-sib F-1
   families from 3 environments in British Columbia, Canada, were used as
   the training population for (1) EBVs (estimated breeding values) of
   juvenile height (HTJ) in the F-1 generation predicting genomic EBVs of
   HTJ of 136 individuals in the F-2 generation, (2) deregressed EBVs of
   F-1 HTJ predicting deregressed genomic EBVs of F-2 HTJ, (3) F-1 mature
   height (HT35) predicting HTJ EBVs in F-2, and (4) deregressed F-1 HT35
   predicting genomic deregressed HTJ EBVs in F-2. Ridge regression best
   linear unbiased predictor (RRBLUP), generalized ridge regression (GRR),
   and Bayes-B GS methods were used and compared to pedigree-based (ABLUP)
   predictions. GS accuracies for scenarios 1 (0.92, 0.91, and 0.91) and 3
   (0.57, 0.56, and 0.58) were similar to their ABLUP counterparts (0.92
   and 0.60, respectively) (using RR-BLUP, GRR, and Bayes-B). Results using
   deregressed values fell dramatically for both scenarios 2 and 4 which
   approached zero in many cases. Cross-generational GS validation of
   juvenile height in Douglas-fir produced predictive accuracies almost as
   high as that of ABLUP. Without capturing LD, GS cannot surpass the
   prediction of ABLUP. Here we tracked pedigree relatedness between
   training and validation sets. More markers or improved distribution of
   markers are required to capture LD in Douglas-fir. This is essential for
   accurate forward selection among siblings as markers that track pedigree
   are of little use for forward selection of individuals within controlled
   pollinated families.}},

   shape grass responses to drought. However, despite clear evidence that
   grazers move freely in response to forage and water availability,
   drought ecologists have mostly failed to consider how these
   landscape-scale processes influence vegetation responses to drought.
   Here, we ask how rainfall variability and drought, in interaction with
   population dynamics and movement of large grazers, shape grass layer
   responses in extant savanna landscapes in Kruger National Park in South
   Africa. We found that grass biomass was highly responsive to rainfall
   variability; notably, grass declines during drought were especially
   severe-even more severe than previously documented elsewhere. Grazing
   probably contributed, exacerbating drought effects in droughted regions
   and spatially extending them into non-droughted refugia, where grass
   biomass also declined. Moreover, the existence of these refugia
   potentially prevented a grazer population crash. Synthesis. Our current
   focus on the physiological effects of drought is probably insufficient
   for understanding vegetation responses to drought. A renewed focus on
   landscape processes, including animal movement, will be critical to
   predicting savanna responses to increasingly frequent extreme events.}},

   predators), and the implications for plant growth and reproduction have
   received little attention. Here, we asked whether simulated early insect
   leaf damage on wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) affected subsequent
   damage by insect leaf chewers and pathogenic fungi, as well as ant
   abundance. To address the mechanisms behind such effects, we measured
   plant defensive traits induced by early leaf damage to determine which
   inducible traits might determine the effects on plant-associates. We
   also evaluated whether early damage influenced plant growth and flower
   production, and if such effects were mediated by subsequent insect
   herbivory or pathogen infection. We show that simulated early leaf
   damage reduced damage by subsequent leaf-chewing insects, increased
   plant fungal infections, but did not affect ant abundance. Leaf
   defensive traits (lignins and pubescence) were significantly induced by
   early damage and were negatively associated with insect herbivory and
   infection severity, but did not account for the effects of early leaf
   damage on either of these subsequent attackers. In addition, ant
   abundance was not associated with (or accounted for) subsequent
   herbivory or infection, suggesting they did not confer plant protection.
   Finally, early leaf damage negatively affected plant growth and flower
   production and analyses suggested that the effect on the latter was, at
   least partly, mediated by increased fungal infections. Synthesis.
   Overall, these findings show that early herbivory determines the outcome

   require predicting fitness responses to variations in environmental
   conditions. For ectotherms, this challenge requires methods to scale-up
   microclimatic information into actual body temperatures, T-b, while
   dealing with uncertainty regarding individual behaviors and
   physiological constraints. Here, we propose an information-theoretical
   model to derive microhabitat selection and T-b distributions of
   ectotherm populations from microclimatic data. The model infers the most
   probable allocation of individuals among the available microenvironments
   and the associated population-level T-b distribution. Using empirical
   T-b data of 41 species of desert lizards from three independently
   evolved systems-Western North America, Kalahari Desert, and Western
   Australia-we show that the model accurately predicts empirical T-b
   distributions across the three systems. Moreover, the framework
   naturally provides a way to quantify the importance of thermoregulation
   in a thermal environment and thereby a measurement for the constraint
   imposed by the climatic conditions. By predicting T-b distributions of
   ectotherm populations even without exhaustive information on the
   underpinning mechanisms, our approach forms a solid theoretical basis
   for upscaling microclimatic and physiological information into a
   population-level fitness trait. This scaling process is a first step to
   reliably project the biological impacts of climate change to broad
   temporal and spatial scales.

   Australia-mostramos que el modelo logra predecir con precision las
   distribuciones de T-b a traves de los tres sistemas. Ademas de esto, el
   metodo permite cuantificar la importancia de la termorregulacion en un
   ambiente termico y con ello, aportar una medida de las restricciones
   termicas impuestas por las condiciones climaticas. Al predecir la
   distribucion de T-b de poblaciones de ectotermos, aun en ausencia de
   informacion exhaustiva de los mecanismos subyacentes, nuestro modelo
   aporta una base teorica solida para estimar un rasgo relacionado con la
   eficacia biologica a nivel poblacional a partir de informacion
   microclimatica y fisiologica. Este es un primer paso para predecir de
   manera fiable los impactos bioticos del cambio climatico a escalas
   espaciales y temporales amplias.}},

   senescence, but measuring telomeres remains a challenge. Within tissue
   samples, TL varies between cells and chromosomes. Class I telomeres are
   (presumably static) interstitial telomeric sequences, while terminal
   telomeres have been divided in shorter (Class II) telomeres and
   ultralong (Class III) telomeres, and the presence of the latter varies
   strongly between species. Class II telomeres typically shorten with age,
   but little is known of Class III telomere dynamics. Using multiple
   experimental approaches, we show great tits to have ultralong telomeres,
   and we investigated age effects on Class II and III telomeres using a
   longitudinal approach (our method excludes Class I telomeres). In
   adults, TL averaged over the whole distribution did not significantly
   change with age. However, more detailed analyses showed that Class II TL
   did shorten with age, and, as in other species, the longest Class II
   telomeres within individuals shortened more quickly with age. In
   contrast, Class III TL did not shorten with age within individual
   adults. Surprisingly, we found the opposite pattern in nestlings: Class
   III TL shortened significantly with age, while the age effect on Class
   II TL was close to zero. Thus, Class III TL may provide information on
   developmental history, while Class II TL provides information on
   telomere dynamics in adulthood. These findings have practical
   implications for telomere studies and raise the interesting question of
   what causes variation in TL dynamics between chromosomes within

   viability. Sexual conflict frequently leads to behavioural adaptations
   that allow males to displace their rivals, but in doing so harm those
   same females they are competing to access, which can decrease population
   viability and facilitate extinction. We are far from understanding what
   factors modulate the intensity of sexual conflict and particularly the
   role of ecology in mediating underlying behavioural adaptations. In this
   study, we show that, in Drosophila melanogaster, variations in
   environmental temperature of +/- 4 degrees C decrease male harm impact
   on female fitness by between 45\% and 73\%. Rate-sensitive fitness
   estimates indicate that such modulation results in an average rescue of
   population productivity of 7\% at colder temperatures and 23\% at hotter
   temperatures. Our results: (a) show that the thermal ecology of social
   interactions can drastically modulate male harm via behavioural
   plasticity, (b) identify a potentially crucial ecological factor to
   understand how sexual conflict operates in nature and (c), along with
   recent studies, suggest that behaviourally plastic responses can lessen
   the negative effect of sexual conflict on population viability in the

   It is thought that spatial structure limits the scale of competitive
   interactions and protracts selective sweeps. This may allow microbial
   populations to simultaneously explore multiple evolutionary paths. But
   how structured a microbial population must be before this effect is
   realized is not known. We used empirical and simulation studies to
   explore the relationship between spatial structure and the maintenance
   of diversity. The degree of spatial structure experienced by Escherichia
   coli metapopulations was manipulated by varying the migration rate
   between its component subpopulations. Each subpopulation was inoculated
   with an equal number of two equally fit genotypes, and their frequencies
   in 12 subpopulations were determined during 150 generations of
   evolution. We observed that the frequency of the ``loser{''} genotypes
   decreased exponentially as the migration rate between the subpopulations
   was increased and that higher frequencies of the loser genotypes were
   maintained in structured metapopulations. These results demonstrate that
   structured microbial populations can evolve along multiple evolutionary

   are rare among trap builders because they use only materials found in
   the environment. We show how antlions exploit the properties of the
   substrate to produce very effective structures in the minimum amount of
   time. Our modelling demonstrates how antlions: (i) exploit
   self-stratification in granular media differentially to expose
   deleterious large grains at the bottom of the construction trench where
   they can be ejected preferentially, and (ii) minimize completion time by
   spiral rather than central digging. Both phenomena are confirmed by our
   experiments. Spiral digging saves time because it enables the antlion to
   eject material initially from the periphery of the pit where it is less
   likely to topple back into the centre. As a result, antlions can produce
   their pits-lined almost exclusively with small slippery grains to
   maximize powerful avalanches and hence prey capture-much more quickly
   than if they simply dig at the pit's centre. Our demonstration, for the

   in the tropics and subtropics. At the latitudinal region with the
   highest ratio, in southeastern Brazil, we confirmed that colonial
   species dominate space on artificial plates in two independent studies
   of five fouling communities. We manipulated settlement plates to measure
   effects of predation and competition on growth and survivorship of
   colonial versus solitary ascidians. Eight species were subjected to a
   predation treatment, i.e. caged versus exposed to predators, and a
   competition treatment, i.e. leaving versus removing competitors, to
   assess main and interactive effects. Predation had a greater effect on
   growth and survivorship of colonial compared to solitary species,
   whereas competition did not show consistent patterns. We hypothesize
   that colonial ascidians dominate at this subtropical site despite being
   highly preyed upon because they regrow when partially consumed and can
   adjust in shape and space to grow into refuges. We contend that these
   means of avoiding mortality from predation can have large influences on
   diversification patterns of colonial species at low latitudes, where
   predation intensity is greater.}},

  abstract                   = {{A mechanistic understanding of the causes of naturalization in
   terrestrial plant communities, and the consequences for associated
   ecosystems, relies on understanding whether and how native and
   non-native plant traits differ. Traits of non-native plants may either
   help them compete or avoid competition with natives, and depending on
   their interaction with the native community, the non-native may act as
   more or less of an active driver vs. a passive passenger of change in
   the native ecosystem. Trait comparisons between native and non-native
   plants are often laboratory-based, providing insights that can be
   difficult to apply to natural communities. Studies of the impacts of
   non-native plants, by contrast, are generally performed in natural
   communities, but usually do not compare observed impacts of the
   non-natives with those exerted by dominant natives on each other and the
   community. Thus, the likely relative disruption of the non-native to the
   community is unclear. In a four-year observational study conducted at
   the microhabitat scale in the herbaceous layer of a Midwestern oak
   forest, we compared the non-native herb Alliaria petiolata (garlic
   mustard) with dominant native herbaceous species in terms of
   correlational patterns related to three broad categories of traits: (1)
   environmental correlates (light, topography, soil nutrients) with
   presence and cover, (2) inter-annual regeneration and phenology, and (3)
   associations with other species (competition and herbivory). We found
   that Alliaria differed strongly from dominant native herbs in all three
   categories. Compared with native herbs, Alliaria was more strongly
   associated with south-facing slopes and high nutrient levels, displayed
   earlier phenology and enhanced dispersal ability, and was strongly
   avoided by the generalist native herbivore, Odocoileus virginianus
   (white-tailed deer). Despite well-described allelopathic effects of
   Alliaria on mycorrhizae and mycorrhizal plants, we found little evidence
   to suggest that Alliaria had negative interactions with native plants
   that were stronger than those of native community members. Overall, our
   data suggest that naturalization of Alliaria in this site is primarily
   due to differences from native plants in phenology, dispersal
   capability, and avoidance of herbivory, and that Alliaria is therefore
   more likely to be acting as a passenger than as a driver of change in
   our site.}},

   phylogenetic homogenization (increasing similarity) or differentiation
   (decreasing similarity) of urban floras. However, it is unknown how
   non-native species influence homogenization of cultivated versus
   spontaneously occurring species in cities, and which traits are
   associated with species that promote homogenization versus
   differentiation. In this study, we compared homogenization effects of
   cultivated and spontaneous non-native species in yard floras across and
   within seven widely distributed U.S. cities. Additionally, we explored
   which traits explained their particular contribution to homogenization.
   We recorded plant presence/absence in 178 private yards distributed
   among seven metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. We
   compared phylogenetic homogenization effects of non-native species
   within both the cultivated and spontaneous species pools using
   phylogenetic dissimilarities and the homogenization index. Then, we
   expressed contributions of non-native species to the homogenization of
   each pool as a function of two different sets of plant functional traits
   using phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) models across and
   within cities. Across cities, spontaneous non-native species
   homogenized, and cultivated non-native species differentiated, yard
   floras. Within the spontaneous pool, short, small-seeded non-native
   plants and non-native grasses significantly homogenized yard floras.
   Within the cultivated pool, species contribution to homogenization was
   best predicted by plant height, presence of showy flowers, and growth
   form, with non-native grasses significantly homogenizing cultivated yard
   floras. Within cities, non-native species-whether they were cultivated
   or spontaneous- consistently homogenized yard floras of the three
   northern cities and differentiated yard floras of three of the four
   southern cities, suggesting that homogenization processes are context-
   and scale-dependent. Likewise, traits explaining homogenization differed
   substantially among cities. The inconsistent patterns among cities in
   the plant traits that promoted homogenization of both cultivated and
   spontaneous species suggest that local environmental and anthropogenic
   conditions of individual cities imposed strong constraints on trait
   selection. Linking plant functional traits that promote homogenization
   with residents' preferences for vegetation may further enhance
   understanding of how yard plant communities assemble at regional and
   local scales.}},

   and removal of a dominant plant species, Festuca thurberi, independently
   and interactively influences fungal colonization patterns and
   performance in a co-dominant plant species, Helianthella quinquenervis.
   Surprisingly, we found N addition and Festuca removal had no measurable
   effects on the colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and
   dark septate endophyte (DSE) or the performance of Helianthella
   seedlings grown with field-collected inoculum in a companion greenhouse
   experiment. However, the proximity of Helianthella to Festuca predicted
   fungal colonization: DSE colonization decreased by 1\% for each cm of
   distance I lelianthella was from Festuca, although the differences in
   fungal inoculum potential had no effect on Helianthella seedling
   survival or biomass. Our results suggest that plant-fungal interactions
   can be resistant to N addition and resilient to the loss of dominant
   plant species. Additionally, our results suggest that soil legacies,
   mediated through surviving symbiont communities or changes in soil

   temperatures, which can immediately impact fitness of breeders, but
   winter temperatures are expected to have a greater impact on development
   and growth of animals with long-lasting consequences. Exposure to warmer
   temperatures can increase cellular oxidative damage in ectotherms. Yet,
   it is unknown whether thermal stress during early life has prolonged
   effects on oxidative status during adulthood. In an experiment using F1
   fish originated from a wild three-spined stickleback population at the
   southern edge of its European distribution, we examined whether
   experimental thermal conditions experienced in winter had carry-over
   effects on oxidative status and telomere length, a marker of accumulated
   stress, in the soma and germline during adulthood. For this, oxidative
   DNA damage, enzymatic antioxidant activities and telomere length were
   measured three months after the termination of the temperature
   manipulation. In addition, we tested whether such delayed effects, if
   any, were due to individuals' compensatory growth after experiencing
   unfavourable growth conditions in winter. Warm acclimation during winter
   induced increased levels of oxidative DNA damage in muscle and sperm and
   increased enzymatic antioxidant defences in muscle during the breeding
   season. Telomere length of adult fish was not influenced by thermal
   conditions experienced during early life. Winter temperature
   manipulation influenced fish to alter the temporal pattern of growth
   trajectories across the juvenile and adult stages. Fish reared in warm
   winter conditions grew at a slower rate than the controls during the
   period of temperature manipulation then accelerated body mass gain to
   catch up during the breeding season. Faster somatic growth during the
   breeding season incurred a higher cost in terms of oxidative damage in
   the warm-treated individuals. For the first time, we experimentally show
   the long-lasting detrimental effects of thermal stress on and the
   positive link between catch-up growth and oxidative DNA damage in the
   soma and germline. Winter temperature increases due to climate change
   can reduce fertility and survival of fish by inducing catch-up growth.
   The detrimental effects of winter climate change may accumulate across
   generations through the pre-mutagenic DNA damage in the germline.}},

   self-limiting genes can reduce pest insect populations. Substantial
   releases are also a novel resistance management tool, since wild type
   alleles conferring susceptibility to pesticides can dilute resistance
   alleles in target populations. However, a potential barrier is the need
   for large-scale area-wide releases. Here, we address whether localized
   releases of transgenic insects could provide an alternative means of
   population suppression and resistance management, without serious loss
   of efficacy. We used experimental mesocosms constituting insect
   metapopulations to explore the evolution of resistance to the Bacillus
   thuringiensis toxin Cry1Ac in a high-dose/refugia landscape in the
   insect Plutella xylostella. We ran two selection experiments, the first
   compared the efficacy of ``everywhere{''} releases and negative controls
   to a spatially density-dependent or ``whack-a-mole{''} strategy that
   concentrated release of transgenic insects in subpopulations with
   elevated resistance. The second experiment tested the relative efficacy
   of whack-a-mole and everywhere releases under spatially homogenous and
   heterogeneous selection pressure. The whack-a-mole releases were less
   effective than everywhere releases in terms of slowing the evolution of
   resistance, which, in the first experiment, largely prevented the
   evolution of resistance. In contrast to predictions, heterogeneous
   whack-a-mole releases were no more effective under heterogeneous
   selection pressure. Heterogeneous selection pressure did, however,
   reduce total insect population sizes. Whack-a-mole releases provided
   early population suppression, indistinguishable from homogeneous
   everywhere releases. However, insect population densities tracked the
   evolution of resistance in this system, as phenotypic resistance
   provides access to additional diet containing the toxin Cry1Ac. Thus, as
   resistance levels diverged between treatments, carrying capacities and
   population sizes increased under the whack-a-mole approach. Synthesis
   and applications. Spatially density-dependent releases of transgenic
   insects, particularly those targeting source populations at a landscape
   level, could suppress pest populations in the absence of blanket
   area-wide releases. The benefits of self-limiting transgenic insects
   were reduced in spatially localized releases, suggesting that they are
   not ideal for ``spot{''} treatment of resistance problems. Nevertheless,
   spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous releases could be used to support
   other resistance management interventions.}},

   restoration of old fields. Despite the large extension of restored
   forests, the success of contrasting restoration strategies (active -
   planted forests - vs. passive - secondary forests -) over time has never
   been evaluated in Mediterranean forests. We studied how restoration
   strategy determined forest restoration success. We evaluated which
   restoration strategy resulted in forests more like references (i.e.
   forests with continuous canopy cover since at least the 1940s) in terms
   of structure, diversity, functional composition, and dynamics. We then
   assessed whether active restoration accelerated forest recovery compared
   to passive restoration. We studied a chronosequence of recovery in four
   forest types (mountain and Mediterranean pine forests and mesic and
   Mediterranean oak forests) using the data of the Spanish Forest
   Inventory in central Spain. Each plot was classified as planted,
   secondary or reference forest. We modelled the response ratios of 11
   forest attributes and a multifunctionality index as a function of
   restoration strategy, forest age, and abiotic and biotic constraints.
   Secondary forests showed a greater likeness to references than planted
   forests in oak forests while minor differences between secondary and
   planted forests were found in pine forests. The recovery speed of most
   forest attributes in secondary and planted forests was similar.
   Multifunctionality was higher, and increased more rapidly, in planted
   than in secondary forests in Mediterranean oak forests. However,
   multifunctionality was similar for both restoration strategies in the
   other forest types. Synthesis and applications. The long-term assessment
   of forest recovery in Mediterranean abandoned fields indicated that both
   planted forests and natural forest succession are successful restoration
   strategies, depending on the aim and the forest type. In our research,
   restoration strategy did not influence the magnitude and speed of forest
   recovery in pine forests. However, in oak forests, natural forest
   succession led to forests more alike to references, but planted forests
   can maximize and accelerate recovery of forest multifunctionality.}},

  abstract                   = {{Age structure is a fundamental aspect of animal population biology. Age
   is strongly related to individual physiological condition, reproductive
   potential and mortality rate. Currently, there are no robust molecular
   methods for age estimation in birds. Instead, individuals must be ringed
   as chicks to establish known-age populations, which is a
   labour-intensive and expensive process. The estimation of chronological
   age using DNA methylation (DNAm) is emerging as a robust approach in
   mammals including humans, mice and some non-model species. Here, we
   quantified DNAm in whole blood samples from a total of 71 known-age
   Short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris) using digital
   restriction enzyme analysis of methylation (DREAM). The DREAM method
   measures DNAm levels at thousands of CpG dinucleotides throughout the
   genome. We identified seven CpG sites with DNAm levels that correlated
   with age. A model based on these relationships estimated age with a mean
   difference of 2.8 years to known age, based on validation estimates from
   models created by repeated sampling of training and validation data
   subsets. Longitudinal observation of individuals re-sampled over 1 or 2
   years generally showed an increase in estimated age (6/7 cases). For the
   first time, we have shown that epigenetic changes with age can be
   detected in a wild bird. This approach should be of broad interest to
   researchers studying age biomarkers in non-model species and will allow
   identification of markers that can be assessed using targeted techniques
   for accurate age estimation in large population studies.}},

  abstract                   = {{Current understanding of mutualistic networks is grounded largely in
   data on interaction frequency, yet mutualistic network dynamics are also
   shaped by interaction quality-the functional outcomes of individual
   interactions on reproduction and survival. The difficulty of obtaining
   data on functional outcomes has resulted in limited understanding of
   functional variation among a network's pairwise species interactions, of
   the study designs that are necessary to capture major sources of
   functional variation, and of predictors of functional variation that may
   allow generalization across networks. In this community-scale study, we
   targeted a key functional outcome in plant-frugivore networks: the
   impact of frugivore gut passage on seed germination. We used captive
   frugivore feeding trials and germination experiments in an island
   ecosystem, attaining species-level coverage across all extant native
   frugivores and the plants they consume to (a) assess sources of
   functional variation, (b) separate effects of pulp removal from those of
   scarification via gut passage, and (c) test trait-based correlates of
   gut passage effect sizes. We found antagonistic seed predation effects
   of a frugivore previously assumed to be a seed disperser, highlighting
   the need to consider functional outcomes rather than interaction
   frequency alone. The other frugivores each exhibited similar impacts for
   individual plant species, with benefits primarily caused by pulp removal
   rather than scarification, supporting the use of animal functional
   groups in this context. In contrast, plant species varied widely in
   impacts of gut passage on germination. Species with smaller seeds and
   more frugivore partners had larger benefits of gut passage, showing
   promise for network metrics and functional traits to predict functional
   variation among plants. Synthesis. Combining network and demographic
   approaches, we assessed the degree and sources of variation in a key
   functional outcome of plant-frugivore interactions across an entire
   network. Using a detailed study design, our work shows how simpler study
   designs can capture primary sources of functional variation and that
   functional traits and network metrics may allow generalization across
   networks. Efficiently measuring and generalizing sources of functional
   variation within mutualistic networks will strengthen our ability to
   model network dynamics and predict mutualist responses to global change.}},

   facilitated by the use of neighbourhood models that examine the
   interactions between a focal tree and its neighbours using a fixed
   radius. However, different studies have chosen different radii without
   clear reasons, hampering the understanding of mechanisms structuring
   tree communities. Using functional trait and tree demography data from
   the Luquillo subtropical forest in Puerto Rico, we compared
   fixed-neighbourhood models with a canopy overlap model, in which tree
   crown overlap is used as an indicator of neighbourhood crowding.
   Analyses that combine functional trait and demographic data provide a
   mechanistic understanding of observed patterns of community structure
   and dynamics as they provide insights into the linkages between
   phenotypes and the environment. Overall, canopy overlap models had
   better support when compared to neighbourhood models using a fixed
   radius, suggesting that the fixed radius approach does not capture the
   full extent of competitive interactions among trees. Moreover, the
   effects of functional neighbourhood on tree survival and growth differ
   depending on the type of approach used and lead to different conclusions
   with respect to the drivers of tree community dynamics. Synthesis. In
   summary, our findings highlight the utility of neighbourhood models
   based on tree crown overlap, and suggest that applying this same

   uniformity and high growth rate. Males of O. aureus (Oa) and females of
   O. niloticus (On) produce all-male offspring, but there is a behavioral
   reproductive barrier between the two species that prevents mass
   production. In crosses between Oa and On broodstocks, few hybrid females
   are attracted to the Oa male nests (denoted responders), and if they
   harbor the On alleles for the sex determination (SD) sites on linkage
   groups (LGs) 1, 3, and 23, all-male progeny are produced. Yet, without
   controlling for the alleles underlying SD, the parental stocks gradually
   lose their capability for all-male production. Hypothesizing that
   marker-assisted selection for female responders would allow production
   of sustainable broodstocks, we applied genotyping-by-sequencing to
   generate 4983 informative SNPs from 13 responding and 28 non-responding
   females from two full-sib families. Accounting for multiple comparisons
   in a genome-wide association study, seven SNPs met a false discovery
   rate of 0.061. Lowest nominal probabilities were on LGs 9 and 14, for
   which microsatellite DNA markers were designed within the candidate
   genes PTGDSL and CASRL, respectively. By increasing the sample size to
   22 responders and 47 non-responders and by genotyping additional
   established microsatellites, we confirmed the association of these LGs
   with female responsiveness. The combined effects of microsatellites
   GM171 and CARSL-LOC100690618 on LGs 9 and 14 explained 37\% of the
   phenotypic variance of reproductive interaction (p < 0.0001). Based on

  abstract                   = {{Ancestral environmental conditions can impact descendant phenotypes
   through a variety of epigenetic mechanisms. Previous studies on
   transgenerational effects in Drosophila melanogaster suggest that
   parental nutrition may affect the body size, developmental duration and
   egg size of the next generation. However, it is unknown whether these
   effects on phenotype remain stable across generations, or if specific
   generations have general responses to ancestral diet. In the current
   study, we examined the effect on multiple life-history phenotypes of
   changing diet quality across three generations. Our analysis revealed
   unforeseen patterns in how phenotypes respond to dietary restriction.
   Our generalized linear model showed that when considering only two
   generations, offspring phenotypes were primarily affected by their own
   diet, and to a lesser extent by the diet of their parents or the
   interaction between the two generations. Surprisingly, however, when
   considering three generations, offspring phenotypes were primarily
   impacted by their grandparents' diet and their own diet. Interactions
   among different generations' diets affected development time, egg volume
   and pupal mass more than ovariole number or wing length. Furthermore,
   pairwise comparisons of diet groups from the same generation revealed
   commonalities in strong responses to rich versus poor diet: ovariole
   number, pupal mass and wing length responded more strongly to poor diet
   than to rich diet, while development time responded strongly to both
   rich and poor diets. To improve investigations into the mechanisms and
   consequences of transgenerational, epigenetic inheritance, future
   studies should closely examine how phenotypes change across a higher
   number of generations, and consider responses to broader variability in
   diet treatments.}},

   investigated independent and interactive effects of warming and

   its associated microbiome in experimental mesocosms. Microbial
   communities were affected by warming and, during the first week, by
   acidification. During the second week, kelp developed disease-like
   symptoms previously observed in the field. The tissue of some kelp
   blistered, bleached and eventually degraded, particularly under the
   acidification treatments, affecting photosynthetic efficiency. Microbial
   communities differed between blistered and healthy kelp for all
   treatments, except for those under future conditions of warming and
   acidification, which after two weeks resembled assemblages associated
   with healthy hosts. This indicates that changes in the microbiome were
   not easily predictable as the severity of future climate scenarios

   increasingly and effectively mitigated with exclusion fencing and
   crossing structures, but this solution potentially changes wildlife
   habitat use and distribution to increase the risk of mortality on
   adjacent, unmitigated railways. We investigated this potential
   side-effect of mitigating the TransCanada Highway, which was completed
   in sections between 1983 and 2013, on the rate of wildlife mortality on
   the nearby transcontinental mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway in
   Banff National Park. For each transportation class (highway and
   railway), we calculated collision rate as the number of collisions per
   year and km for two guilds (carnivores and ungulates) before and after
   mitigation occurred between 1981 and 2014. We constructed additional
   models for each transportation class and each of four species groups
   with adequate sample sizes: elk (Cerous canadensis), other ungulates
   (family Cervidae), bears (Ursus spp.), and coyotes (Canis latrans).
   Across guilds, mortality rates declined after mitigation, particularly
   on the highway (as expected) and most strongly for ungulates. For
   individual species groups, mortality on the railway for elk was best
   predicted by year and population size, without the inclusion of
   mitigation status on the adjacent highway. However, collision rates on
   the railway increased after mitigation for other ungulates (mostly deer,
   Odocoileus spp.) while also increasing over time. Collision rates on the
   railway increased over time for bears, but not in relation to highway
   mitigation. We found no evidence that the spatial distribution of
   collisions on the railway changed after highway mitigation, as might be
   expected from a funneling effect of crossing structures. Our results
   support and extend previous work demonstrating that exclusion fencing
   and wildlife crossing structures reduce wildlife mortalities on the
   highway at this location, and provide limited evidence, for other
   ungulates alone, that such mitigation may increase mortality on the
   adjacent railway. Similar analyses are warranted in other locations,
   particularly mountainous regions, where major transportation features
   often occur in close proximity.}},

   trout (Salvelinus fontinails) within the Chesapeake Bay watershed that
   incorporates both land use and climate stressors. Our specific
   objectives were to (1) construct a continuous spatial model of brook
   trout distribution and habitat quality at the stream reach scale; (2)
   characterize brook trout vulnerability to climate change under a range
   of future climate scenarios; and (3) identify multi-scale restoration
   and protection priorities for brook trout across the Chesapeake Bay
   watershed. Boosted regression tree analysis predicted brook trout
   occurrence at the stream reach scale with a high degree of accuracy (CV
   AUC = 0.92) as a function of both natural (e.g., water temperature and
   precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., agriculture and urban
   development) landscape and climatic attributes. Current land use
   activities result in a predicted loss of occurrence in over 11,000
   stream segments (40\% of suitable habitat) and account for over 15,000
   km (45\% of current value) of lost functional brook trout fishery value
   (i.e., length-weighted occurrence probability) in the Chesapeake Bay
   watershed. Climate change (increased ambient temperatures and altered
   precipitation) is projected to result in a loss of occurrence in at
   least 3000 additional segments (19\% of current value) and at least 3000
   km of functional fishery value (9\% of current value) by 2062. Model
   outcomes were used to identify low- and high-quality stream segments
   within relatively intact and degraded sub-watersheds as restoration and
   protection priorities, respectively, and conservation priorities were
   targeted in watersheds with high projected resilience to climate change.
   Our results suggest that traditional restoration activities, such as
   habitat enhancement, riparian management, and barrier removal, may be
   able to recover a substantial amount of brook trout habitat lost to
   historic landscape change. However, restoration efforts must be designed
   within the context of expected impacts from climate change or those
   efforts may not produce long-term benefits to brook trout in this
   region.}},

   services, which may be under threat from a changing climate. However,
   these effects may not be homogenous across ecosystem functions, wetland
   types, ecoregions, or meso-scale watersheds, making broad application of
   the same management techniques inappropriate. Here, we present a
   relative wetland vulnerabilities framework, applicable across a range of
   spatial and temporal scales, to assist in identifying effective and
   robust management strategies in light of climate change. We deconstruct
   vulnerability into dimensions of exposure and sensitivity/adaptive
   capacity, and identify relevant measures of these as they pertain to the
   attributes of wetland extent and plant community composition. As a test
   of the framework, we populate it with data for three primary
   hydrogeomorphic wetland types (riverine, slope, and depression) in seven
   small watersheds across four ecoregions (Ridge and Valley, Piedmont,
   Unglaciated Plateau, and Glaciated Plateau) in the Susquehanna River
   watershed in Pennsylvania. We use data generated from the SRES A2
   emissions experiment and MRI-CGCM2.3.2 dimate model as input to the Penn
   State Integrated Hydrologic Model to simulate future exposure to altered
   hydrologic conditions in our seven watersheds, as expressed in two
   hydrologic metrics: \% time groundwater levels occur in the upper 30 cm
   (rooting zone) during the growing season, and median difference between
   spring and summer mean water levels. We then examine the spatial and
   temporal scales at which each of the components of vulnerability
   (exposure and sensitivity/adaptive capacity) shows significant relative
   differences. Overall, we find that relative differences in exposure
   persist at a very fine spatial grain, exhibiting high variability even
   among individual watersheds in a given ecoregion. For temporal scale, we
   find strong seasonal but weak annual relative differences in exposure
   resulting from a magnification of summer dry-down combined with winter
   and spring wet periods becoming wetter. Sensitivities/adaptive
   capacities show significant differences among wetland types. A
   comparison between our anticipated hydrologic alterations under dimate
   change and historical changes in hydrology due to anthropogenic
   disturbance indicates potential shifts in hydrologic patterns that are
   far beyond anything that wetland managers have experienced in the past.}},

   conditions across its native range in southern and eastern Asia, which
   includes high-altitude regions. eastern honey bees inhabiting mountains
   differ morphologically from neighbouring lowland populations and may
   also exhibit differences in physiology and behaviour. We compared the
   genomes of 60 eastern honey bees collected from high and low altitudes
   in Yunnan and Gansu provinces, China, to infer their evolutionary
   history and to identify candidate genes that may underlie adaptation to
   high altitude. Using a combination of F-ST-based statistics, long-range
   haplotype tests and population branch statistics, we identified several
   regions of the genome that appear to have been under positive selection.
   These candidate regions were strongly enriched for coding sequences and
   had high haplotype homozygosity and increased divergence specifically in
   highland bee populations, suggesting they have been subjected to recent
   selection in high-altitude habitats. Candidate loci in these genomic
   regions included genes related to reproduction and feeding behaviour in
   honey bees. Functional investigation of these candidate loci is
   necessary to fully understand the mechanisms of adaptation to

   investigated by testing for multilocus heterozygosity-fitness
   correlations (HFCs), but few studies have been able to assess HFCs

   26-year longitudinal individual-based data set from a large population

   chicks and breeders of known age were genotyped at 15 microsatellite
   loci and sampled for life-history traits over the complete life cycle.
   Heterozygosity was not correlated with fledging or post-fledging
   prospecting probabilities, but was positively correlated with
   recruitment probability. For breeders, annual survival was not
   correlated with heterozygosity, but annual fledgling production was
   negatively correlated with heterozygosity in males and highest in
   intermediately heterozygous females. The contrasting HFCs among life

   established in statistical physics, and calls are increasing for their
   adoption by community ecologists. Multilayer networks in community
   ecology will allow space, time and multiple interaction types to be
   incorporated into species interaction networks. While the multilayer
   network framework is applicable to ecological questions, it is one thing
   to be able to describe ecological communities as multilayer networks and
   another for multilayer networks to actually prove useful for answering
   ecological questions. Importantly, documenting multilayer network
   structure requires substantially greater empirical investment than
   standard ecological networks. In response, we argue that this additional
   effort is worthwhile and describe a series of research lines where we
   expect multilayer networks will generate the greatest impact.
   Inter-layer edges are the key component that differentiate multilayer
   networks from standard ecological networks. Inter-layer edges join
   different networkstermed layerstogether and represent ecological
   processes central to the species interactions studied (e.g., inter-layer
   edges representing movement for networks separated in space).
   Inter-layer edges may take a variety of forms, be species- or
   network-specific, and be measured with a large suite of empirical
   techniques. Additionally, the sheer size of ecological multilayer
   networks also requires some changes to empirical data collection around
   interaction quantification, collaborative efforts and collation in
   public databases. Network ecology has already touched on a wide swath of
   ecology and evolutionary biology. Because network stability and patterns
   of species linkage are the most developed areas of network ecology, they
   are a natural starting place for multilayer investigations. However,
   multilayer networks will also provide novel insights to niche
   partitioning, the connection between traits and species' interactions,
   and even the geographic mosaic of co-evolution.Synthesis. Multilayer
   networks provide a formal way to bring together the study of species
   interaction networks and the processes that influence them. However,
   describing inter-layer edges and the increasing amounts of data required
   represent challenges. The pay-off for added investment will be
   ecological networks that describe the composition and capture the
   dynamics of ecological communities more completely and, consequently,
   have greater power for understanding the patterns and processes that
   underpin diversity in ecological communities.}},

   capacity to dissipate metabolic heat can increase reproductive
   investment. This theory remains untested in the wild. We recently showed
   that increased workload in a small bird causally relates to maximum body
   temperature. Here, we have expanded this approach by experimentally
   facilitating sensible heat transfer rate in nestling-feeding blue titsa
   small bird with high resting- and work-induced body temperaturesthrough
   removal of ventral plumage. Feather-clipped parents did not increase
   work rate but sired larger, and sometimes heavier, nestlings while
   maintaining lower body temperature and losing less body mass than
   controls. Thus, when relieved of the demands to dissipate metabolic
   heat, parents could invest more into both current (nestling condition)
   and future (self-maintenance) reproduction. In accordance with the HDL
   theory, we conclude that constraints on heat dissipation rate could be a
   potent mediator of life-history trade-offs in wild animals.}},

   has significant implications for efforts to understand and manage
   enigmatic species like the whale shark Rhincodon typus. The ecological
   relevance of differences in tissue isotopes within and between
   individuals in the context of foraging however depends on understanding
   tissue turnover times and carbon (Delta C-13) and nitrogen (Delta N-15)
   discrimination, which can vary with physiology, metabolism, and diet
   quality. Here, we examine isotope dynamics in captive R. typus as a
   basis for enhanced ecological insights into wild populations of the
   world's largest fish and other enigmatic species. A variable diet,
   principally consisting of two krill (Euphausia pacifica and Euphausia
   superba) provided an average of 48 +/- 20 MJ/d (mean +/- SD), or 2.7 +/-
   1.3 times basal metabolic requirements. On this diet, in agreement with
   allometric relationships, large body sizes (3,000-4,000 kg) were matched
   by slow plasma and cartilage turnover rates (empirically derived as 9
   months and 3 yr, respectively), which provide tissue-specific limits on
   the timescales over which we can isotopically detect diet changes in
   this species. Average diet-to-tissue discrimination showed significant
   variation between tissues (plasma and cartilage), and among growing and
   fasting individuals (Delta C-13 range, 1.5 to 5.5 parts per thousand;
   Delta N-15 range, -0.1 to 2.9 parts per thousand). Assimilation rates
   increased with temperature and were higher for the smaller E. pacifica
   (15 +/- 2 mm) than E. superba (48 +/- 2 mm). Growth significantly
   lowered both Delta N-15(plasma) and Delta N-15(cartilage), with
   inappetence markedly reducing Delta N-15(plasma) and Delta C-13(plasma),
   as well as significantly altering blood biochemistry. Captive findings
   facilitated the first robust multi-tissue growth- and
   nutrition-corrected isotope analysis of a wild R. typus population,
   suggesting individual foraging specialization on low trophic level
   mid-ocean or coastal prey. Long-term fasting during ocean-basin-scale
   migrations may be common and such metabolic effects should be carefully
   quantified when isotopically assessing intra-species foraging
   differences. The metabolically constrained multi-tissue, multi-isotope
   approach described can facilitate ecological insights that are
   indispensable for effective conservation and management of globally
   threatened, but poorly understood, species by identifying differences in
   key foraging areas and target prey within and between individuals.}},

   plants. Performance of their colonies depends on pollen and nectar as
   food resources, but flowering plants are scarce in modern agricultural
   landscapes. It is well-known that semi-natural habitats can enhance
   floral resources and bumblebee abundance, but the impact of different
   crop types and their heterogeneity at the landscape scale remains
   unclear. We tested the effect of two different crop types (oilseed rape
   {[}OSR] and maize) and of configurational (field border density) and
   compositional heterogeneity (crop diversity) on weight gain of
   buff-tailed bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris) and the pollen
   diversity collected by them in 20 landscapes in Central Germany. We
   found that augmenting maize cover had a detrimental effect on pollen
   diversity collected by bumblebees, probably due to intensive management
   resulting in low plant diversity. This low pollen diversity translated
   into reduced colony growth, since colonies with high pollen diversity
   gained more weight than colonies with low pollen diversity. In contrast,
   OSR cover and configurational and compositional heterogeneity did
   neither affect colony growth nor pollen diversity. However, for OSR, the
   timing of the flowering period was important. When OSR fields had a high
   flower cover at the end of the OSR blooming period, colonies showed
   increased growth rates. Synthesis and applications. Our results
   complement previous laboratory studies by showing that high pollen
   diversity leads to better colony performance under field conditions.
   Therefore, the maintenance of floral diversity in agricultural
   landscapes is crucial to ensure that bumblebees can fulfil their
   nutritional needs. However, the heterogeneity of crops, at least under
   the currently very low levels of crop rotation, does not contribute to
   this aim. In contrast, crop identity and timing of mass-flowering crops
   turned out to be important factors, as maize reduced pollen resources,
   while late blooming oilseed rape (OSR) was beneficial to bumblebee
   colonies. Hence, maize cover per landscape should be reduced and
   strategies to enhance landscape wide flower diversity, especially
   towards and after the end of oilseed rape bloom, should be promoted to
   support bumblebee colonies that provide important pollination services.}},

   abundances of common, generalist species in disturbed habitats may be
   driven by reduced competition from specialists in similar habitats. We
   quantified habitat availability for and utilization of three
   co-occurring arboreal geckos (Australian native house geckos {[}Gehyra
   dubia], northern velvet geckos {[}Oedura castelnaui] and eastern
   spiny-tailed geckos {[}Strophurus williamsi]) in four replicated grazing
   regimes in an experimental grazing trial in north-east Queensland,
   Australia. Native house geckos were most abundant in heavily grazed
   habitats, whereas the two other species rarely co-occurred (either with
   each other or with native house geckos). Geckos displayed resource
   partitioning of habitat features, such as tree species and structural
   characteristics. We found evidence of interspecific competition among
   gecko species, in which native house geckos shifted their habitat
   selection in the presence of velvet geckos. In the absence of other
   geckos, native house geckos preferred rough, peeling bark and dead
   trees, yet in the presence of velvet geckos, native house geckos shifted
   away from dead trees, and used more structurally complex trees, probably
   due to high niche overlap with velvet geckos. Native house geckos were
   more resistant to the negative effects of livestock grazing than either
   velvet or spiny-tailed geckos. In the absence of other species, native
   house geckos used a wider range of microhabitats. Synthesis and
   applications. Species assemblages are often the results of multiple or
   complex factors, including predation pressure, habitat availability or
   competitive interactions. The homogenizing effects on habitat structure
   caused by livestock grazing reduce diversity and suitability for
   microhabitat specialists. Reduced competition can therefore promote the
   abundance of microhabitat generalist species, such as Australian native
   house geckos, suggesting that livestock grazing leads to homogenization
   and simplification of habitat structure, which ultimately leads to
   changes in species composition through reduced competition.
   Understanding species' responses to disturbance, and more broadly,
   habitat complexity, is crucial for maintaining or increasing biological
   diversity in anthropogenically modified landscapes.}},

  abstract                   = {{Biofuel production from cellulosic feedstocks may increase during the
   next century. To be sustainable, this production should protect
   environmental quality and biodiversity. Fertilized mixed-species prairie
   can deliver substantial quantities of cellulosic ethanol per unit land
   area with minimal losses of NO3-N in drainage water, but the long-term
   maintenance of biodiversity in such systems has been uncertain. We
   report how nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer application,
   precipitation, and time affected the species composition and
   productivity of reconstructed prairie communities harvested annually as
   biofuel feedstocks over a 9-year period. Results indicated that both
   precipitation and fertilizer application drove above-ground biomass
   production, with the greatest response to fertilizer occurring in wetter
   than average years. Fertilization reduced species richness, but
   increased species evenness. Consequently, Simpson's diversity index did
   not differ between the fertilized and unfertilized communities, though
   it declined in both communities over time. A total of 59 plant species
   was recorded, with eight of them explaining most of the differences in
   vegetation cover between the fertilized and unfertilized treatments.
   After 9 years, the high fertility community was dominated by the C4
   grass Andropogon gerardii, the C3 grass Elymus canadensis, and the
   non-leguminous forbs Heliopsis helianthoides, Helianthus maximiliani,
   and Monarda fistulosa, whereas the low fertility community was dominated
   by the C4 grasses A. gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, the C3 grass E.
   canadensis, and the non-leguminous forb M. fistulosa. Fertilization
   increased the abundance of flowering forbs available to pollinators in
   the early, middle and late portions of the growing season. Synthesis and
   applications. Results of our study suggest that maintenance of
   reasonably high levels of productivity and biodiversity are possible in
   fertilized prairie communities harvested annually for bioenergy, with
   plant cover more evenly distributed among different functional groups.
   In the future, if policy and markets favour biofuels and better delivery
   of ecosystem services from harvested land, prairie-based feedstocks
   could become part of a renewable energy portfolio that fosters
   biodiversity and contributes to the provision of floral resources for
   pollinators.}},

   aligns scales of environmental variability, animal movement and human
   uses. While static approaches to spatial management rely on one-time
   assessments of biological, environmental, economic, and/or social
   conditions, dynamic approaches repeatedly assess conditions to produce
   regularly updated management recommendations. Owing to this complexity,
   particularly regarding operational challenges, examples of applied DM
   are rare. To implement DM, scientific methodologies are operationalized
   into tools, i.e., self-contained workflows that run automatically at a
   prescribed temporal frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). Here we
   present a start-to-finish framework for operationalizing DM tools,
   consisting of four stages: Acquisition, Prediction, Dissemination, and
   Automation. We illustrate this operationalization framework using an
   applied DM tool as a case study. Our DM tool operates in near real-time
   and was designed to maximize target catch and minimize bycatch of
   non-target and protected species in a US-based commercial fishery. It is
   important to quantify the sensitivity of DM tools to missing data,
   because dissemination streams for observed (i.e., remotely sensed or
   directly sampled) data can experience delays or gaps. To address this
   issue, we perform a detailed example sensitivity analysis using our case
   study tool. Synthesis and applications. Dynamic management (DM) tools
   are emerging as viable management solutions to accommodate the
   biological, environmental, economic, and social variability in our
   fundamentally dynamic world. Our four-stage operationalization framework

   tree regeneration and genetic adaptation in Central European forests.
   Owing to climate change and increasing ungulate numbers, the abiotic and
   biotic environments of trees are changing remarkably, making it
   necessary to investigate the separate and joint effects of seed source
   (i.e., location of tree population origin) and ungulate herbivory. We
   used a common garden experiment to study the growth and morphology of
   Fagus sylvatica saplings from 77 Swiss seed sources. The experiment was
   set up at two sites and included a clipping treatment (i.e., terminal
   shoot clipped at two intensities) applied before budburst to simulate
   winter ungulate browsing. We studied F. sylvatica sapling growth and
   morphology before and two years after clipping. Measured growth traits
   included sapling height, stem diameter, and biomass. Morphological
   traits included multi-stemming, stem and crown form, stem quality, and
   reaction to clipping. Seed source, test site, and simulated leader
   browsing were all important in determining the growth and quality of F.
   sylvatica saplings. The effects of seed source on growth and quality
   indicate that F. sylvatica possesses a large pool of diverse genotypes
   across Switzerland and thus has the potential to adapt to local
   conditions through gene flow. Growth and morphology differed
   significantly between the two test sites, indicating that local
   environments should be considered carefully when a new plantation is
   established. The effect of the single simulated browsing event
   disappeared over time for the growth traits, owing to growth
   compensation. However, sapling quality decreased after clipping,
   suggesting that browsing may lead to persistent quality losses in
   production forests. Neither the growth nor the morphological reaction
   after clipping depended on the effect of population, meaning that
   resilience to browsing was independent of seed source. Consequently,
   interactions with ungulate browsing do not have to be taken into account
   when selecting F. sylvatica populations for particular climatic and site
   conditions.}},

   the distance-decay relationship. While this pattern has been
   investigated for a wide range of organisms, ecosystems and geographical
   gradients, whether these changes vary more cryptically across different
   forest strata (from ground to canopy) remains elusive. Here, we
   investigated the influence of ground vs. arboreal assemblages to the
   general distance-decay relationship observed in forests. We seek to
   explain differences in distance-decay relationships between strata in
   the context of the vertical stratification of assemblage composition,
   richness and abundance. We surveyed for a climate-sensitive model
   organism, amphibians, across vertical rainforest strata in Madagascar.
   For each tree, we defined assemblages of ground-dwelling, understory, or
   canopy species. We calculated horizontal distance-decay in similarity
   across all trees, and across assemblages of species found in different
   forest strata (ground, understory and canopy). We demonstrate that
   within stratum comparisons exhibit a classic distance-decay relationship
   for canopy and understory communities but no distance-decay
   relationships for ground communities. We suggest that differences in
   horizontal turnover between strata may be due to local scale habitat and
   resource heterogeneity in the canopy, or the influence of arboreal
   traits on species dispersal and distribution. Synthesis. Biodiversity
   patterns in horizontal space were not consistent across vertical space,
   suggesting that canopy fauna may not play by the same set of ``rules{''}
   as their conspecifics living below them on the ground. Our study
   provides compelling evidence that the above-ground amphibian assemblage

  abstract                   = {{Huge tracts of tropical forest are selectively logged. Meanwhile,
   emerging global agendas are providing unprecedented incentives for
   large-scale restoration within human-impacted tropical forest
   landscapes. Whilst logged forests have high conservation value, their
   adoption within these agendas remains controversial. We review the value
   of restoring logged tropical forests for boosting economic and
   environmental resilience. Targeted interventions can recover depleted
   timber stocks, increase saleable carbon stores, and deliver employment
   and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to local communities. Restoration
   has mixed outcomes for biodiversity but if it improves relogging
   practices and protects forests from conversion to agricultural
   plantations may have major positive impacts. We also examine
   socio-economic and political pathways for upscaling logged forest
   restoration and their incorporation into sustainable forestry, given
   political and commercial malaise on post-logging interventions. Spurring
   these transitions will require strong institutions, executed by policies
   that enable long-term concession licences and community land tenure,
   that leverage commercial involvement and payments for ecosystem
   services, and that optimise existing interventions. Research frontiers
   include: (a) validating the economic and technical feasibility of
   different interventions; (b) understanding how these interventions
   impact on synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services, NTFPs,
   and biodiversity; and (c) identifying when to restore a logged forest.
   This requires establishing long-term experimental trials that jointly
   track environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. Synthesis and
   applications. Post-logging interventions can deliver various timber,
   carbon, socioeconomic and potentially biodiversity benefits but are
   underemployed and undervalued pantropically. Opportunities exist to
   optimise interventions by tailoring incentives, policies, and management
   to ecological and social circumstances. Governments, conservation bodies
   and the private sector must underscore restoration of production forests
   as a major future objective, including via greater adoption in global
   initiatives, including forest and landscape restoration under the Bonn
   Challenge and the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
   Degradation (REDD+) agenda.}},

  abstract                   = {{Common worldwide and encroaching on even the most remote locations,
   roads negatively affects wildlife through habitat loss, fragmentation
   and direct mortality. Reducing these effects requires mitigation,
   including wildlife crossing structures and fencing. However, mitigation
   measures are expensive and vary in their success level, especially when
   constructed to meet the needs of several species. Moreover, mitigation
   planning rarely considers the needs of multiple species. As funds are
   limited, deciding where and how to act for the greatest return on
   investment is crucial. Combining decision theory with a metapopulation
   model, we determined the most cost-effective actions mitigating the
   effects of roads on multiple species. The model is illustrated with two
   sets of species with varying of life-history traits, from a diversity of
   taxonomic groups. We tested the cost-effectiveness of spatially explicit
   combinations of three management options for each road section: (a) no
   mitigation, (b) fences without wildlife crossings, and (c) fences
   combined with wildlife crossings. We explored the trade-offs between
   each population's probability of persistence and total mitigation cost,
   first on a per-species basis and then considering all species. We then
   tested the cost-effectiveness of different planning strategies: (a)
   single species, (b) two types of focal species based on different
   life-history traits, and (c) comprehensive multispecies planning.
   Planning for the needs of all species at the same time (multispecies
   strategy) maximizes the number of persisting species and provides the
   most robust and cost-effective planning strategy, while single-species
   strategies were found to be inefficient. However, basing decisions on
   the focal species with the largest home range can provide reasonably
   cost-effective results, but should be considered only when there is not
   enough time or money to collect the necessary information to perform a
   multispecies analysis. Synthesis and applications. Our model can be
   adapted to most road mitigation problems. It illustrates that the needs
   of multiple species should be considered to plan a cost-effective road
   mitigation system. However, when resources are limited to plan for all
   species, those with larger home ranges should be used as reasonable
   proxies for other species.}},

   abiotic environment sets the template for defense strategies, imposing a
   trade-off between plant growth and defense. Yet this trade-off, commonly
   found among species occupying divergent resource environments, may not
   occur across populations of single species. We hypothesized that more
   favorable climates and higher levels of herbivory would lead to
   increases in growth and defense across plant populations. We evaluated
   whether plant growth and defense traits covaried across 18 populations
   of showy milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) inhabiting an east-west climate
   gradient spanning 25 degrees of longitude. A suite of traits impacting
   defense (e.g., latex, cardenolides), growth (e.g., size), or both (e.g.,
   specific leaf area {[}SLA], trichomes) were measured in natural
   populations and in a common garden, allowing us to evaluate plastic and
   genetically based variation in these traits. In natural populations,
   herbivore pressure increased toward warmer sites with longer growing
   seasons. Growth and defense traits showed strong clinal patterns and
   were positively correlated. In a common garden, clines with climatic
   origin were recapitulated only for defense traits. Correlations between
   growth and defense traits were also weaker and more negative in the
   common garden than in the natural populations. Thus, our data suggest
   that climatically favorable sites likely facilitate the evolution of
   greater defense at minimal costs to growth, likely because of increased
   resource acquisition.}},

   conflict, resulting in genotype-by-sex (GxS) interactions. Here we
   assess the extent of sexual dimorphism in four risk-taking behaviour
   traits in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, and apply a
   multivariate approach to test for GxS interactions. We also quantify the
   among-individual and genetic covariances between personality and size
   and growth, which are known a priori to differ between the sexes. We
   found significant sexual dimorphism in three of the four behaviours,
   although r(mf) between sex-specific homologous traits was significantly
   <+1 for only one behaviour. Using multivariate models, we then estimated
   sex-specific genetic (co)variance matrices (G(m) and G(f)) and tested
   for asymmetry of the cross-trait cross-sex genetic covariance structure
   (submatrix B). While G(m) and G(f) were not significantly different from
   each other overall, their respective leading eigenvectors were poorly
   aligned. Statistical support for asymmetry in B was found, but limited
   to a single trait pair for which the cross-sex covariances differed
   (i.e., COVA(m,f) not equal COVA(f,m)). Thus, while single- and
   multi-trait perspectives evidence some GxS, the overall picture is one
   of similarity between the sexes in their genetic (co)variance
   structures. Our results suggest behavioural traits related to
   risk-taking may lack the sex-specific genetic architecture for further
   dimorphism to evolve under what is hypothesised to be antagonistic
   selection.}},

   Differences in the combination of surface chemicals called cuticular
   hydrocarbons (CHCs) can influence mating behavior and affect
   reproductive isolation between species. Genes influencing three CHC
   compounds have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the
   genetic basis of other CHC compounds, whether these genes affect species
   differences in CHCs, and the genes' resulting effect on interspecies
   mating, remains unknown. We used fine-scale deficiency mapping of the
   third chromosome to identify 43 genomic regions that influence
   production of CHCs in both D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans
   females. We identified an additional 23 small genomic regions that
   affect interspecies divergence in CHCs between females of these two
   species, one of which spans two genes known to influence the production
   of multiple CHCs within D. melanogaster. By testing these genes
   individually, we determined that desatl also affects interspecific
   divergence in one CHC compound, while desat2 has no effect on
   interspecific divergence. Thus, some but not all genes affecting
   intraspecific amounts of CHCs also affect interspecific divergence, but
   not all genes or all CHCs. Lastly, we find no evidence of a relationship
   between the CHC profile and female attractiveness or receptivity towards
   D. melanogaster males.}},

   distyly to homostyly has occurred repeatedly among families of flowering
   plants. Homostyles can originate by major gene changes at the S-locus
   linkage group, or by unlinked polygenic modifiers. Here, we investigate
   the inheritance of distyly and homostyly in Primula oreodoxa, a
   subalpine herb endemic to Sichuan, China. Controlled self- and
   cross-pollinations confirmed that P. oreodoxa unlike most heterostylous
   species is fully self-compatible. Segregation patterns indicated that
   the inheritance of distyly is governed by a single Mendelian locus with
   the short-styled morph carrying at least one dominant S-allele (S-) and
   long-styled plants homozygous recessive (ss). Crossing data were
   consistent with a model in which homostyly results from genetic changes
   at the distylous linkage group, with the homostylous allele (S-h)
   dominant to the long-styled allele (s), but recessive to the
   short-styled allele (S). Progeny tests of open-pollinated seed families
   revealed high rates of intermorph mating in the L-morph but considerable
   selfing and possibly intramorph mating in the S-morph and in homostyles.
   S-morph plants homozygous at the S-locus (SS) occurred in several
   populations but may experience viability selection. The crossing data
   from distylous and homostylous plants are consistent with either
   recombination at the S-locus governing distyly, or mutation at gene(s)
   controlling sex-organ height; both models predict the same patterns of
   segregation. Recent studies on the molecular genetics of distyly in
   Primula demonstrating the hemizygous nature of genes at the S-locus make
   it more likely that homostyles have resulted from mutation rather than
   recombination.}},

   doubts as to whether current morphological character sets are able to
   accurately resolve mammal relationships. We tested this under a
   hypothetical `best case scenario' by using ancestral state
   reconstruction (under both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood) to
   infer the morphologies of fossil ancestors for all clades present in a
   recent comprehensive DNA sequence-based phylogeny of mammals, and then
   seeing what effect the subsequent inclusion of these predicted ancestors
   had on unconstrained phylogenetic analyses of morphological data. We
   found that this resulted in topologies that are highly congruent with
   the current consensus phylogeny, at least when the predicted ancestors
   are assumed to be well preserved and densely sampled. Most strikingly,
   several analyses recovered the monophyly of clades that have never been
   found in previous morphology-only studies, such as Afrotheria and
   Laurasiatheria. Our results suggest that, at least in principle,
   improvements in the fossil record-specifically the discovery of fossil
   taxa that preserve the ancestral or near-ancestral morphologies of the
   nodes in the current consensus-may be sufficient to largely reconcile
   morphological and molecular estimates of mammal phylogeny, even using

   over time. We investigate this issue by analysing data from two large
   eye-tracking datasets (total n = 176). Via growth-curve analysis, we
   demonstrate that self-reported empathy (as measured by the empathy
   quotient-EQ) predicts the temporal evolution of gaze behaviour under
   conditions where social and non-social stimuli compete for attention. In
   both datasets, we found that EQ not only predicted a global increase in
   social attention, but predicted a different temporal profile of social
   attention. Specifically, we detected a reliable effect of empathy on
   gaze towards social images after prolonged viewing. An analysis of
   switch latencies revealed that low-EQ observers switched gaze away from
   an initially fixated social image more frequently and at earlier
   latencies than high-EQ observers. Our analyses demonstrate that
   modelling these temporal components of gaze signals may reveal useful
   behavioural phenotypes. The explanatory power of this approach may
   provide enhanced biomarkers for conditions marked by deficits in
   empathy-related processes.}},

   able to carry out its life cycle in novel environmental conditions. A
   key trait underlying fitness is the shift from vegetative to
   reproductive growth through floral development. In this study, we used a
   common garden experiment and genotyping-by-sequencing to test whether
   the latitudinal flowering cline of the North American invasive plant
   Medicago polymorpha was translocated from its European native range
   through multiple introductions, or whether the cline rapidly established
   due to evolution following a genetic bottleneck. Analysis of flowering
   time in 736 common garden plants showed a latitudinal flowering time
   cline in both the native and invaded ranges where genotypes from lower
   latitudes flowered earlier. Genotyping-by-sequencing of 9,658 SNPs in
   446 individuals revealed two major subpopulations of M. polymorpha in
   the native range, only one of which is present in the invaded range.
   Additionally, native range populations have higher genetic diversity
   than invaded range populations, suggesting that a genetic bottleneck
   occurred during invasion. All invaded range individuals are closely
   related to plants collected from native range populations in Portugal
   and southern Spain, and population assignment tests assigned invaded
   range individuals to this same narrow source region. Taken together, our
   results suggest that latitudinal clinal variation in flowering time has
   rapidly evolved across the invaded range despite a genetic bottleneck
   following introduction.}},

  abstract                   = {{Colour patterns are used by many species to make decisions that
   ultimately affect their Darwinian fitness. Colour patterns consist of a
   mosaic of patches that differ in geometry and visual properties.
   Although traditionally pattern geometry and colour patch visual
   properties are analysed separately, these components are likely to work
   together as a functional unit. Despite this, the combined effect of
   patch visual properties, patch geometry, and the effects of the patch
   boundaries on animal visual systems, behaviour and fitness are
   relatively unexplored. Here, we describe boundary strength analysis
   (BSA), a novel way to combine the geometry of the edges (boundaries
   among the patch classes) with the receptor noise estimate (Delta S) of
   the intensity of the edges. The method is based upon known properties of
   vertebrate and invertebrate retinas. The mean and SD of Delta S (m(Delta
   S), s(Delta S)) of a colour pattern can be obtained by weighting each
   edge class Delta S by its length, separately for chromatic and
   achromatic Delta S. This assumes those colour patterns, or parts of the
   patterns used in signalling, with larger m(Delta S) and s(Delta S), are
   more stimulating and hence more salient to the viewers. BSA can be used
   to examine both colour patterns and visual backgrounds. Boundary
   strength analysis was successful in assessing the estimated
   conspicuousness of colour pattern variants in two species, guppies
   Poecilia reticulata and Gouldian finches Erythrura gouldiae, both
   polymorphic for patch colour, luminance and geometry. The 3D
   representations of the Delta S of patch edges (Fort Diagrams) of both
   species show that there is little or negative geometric correspondence
   between the chromatic and achromatic edges. All individuals have m(Delta
   S) > 1.5 for both chromatic and achromatic measures, indicating the high
   within-pattern contrast expected for display signals. In contrast from
   what one would expect from sexual selection, all guppies have m(Delta S)
   less than expected from random contacts between all pairs of patch
   colour/luminance classes. The correlation between chromatic and
   luminance Delta S is negative in both species but zero when correlating
   all possible kinds of edges between the colours of each species and
   morph, indicating nonrandom colour geometry. The pattern difference
   between chromatic and achromatic edges in both species reveals the
   possibility that chromatic and achromatic edges could function
   differently. The smaller than random expected m(Delta S) values in
   guppies suggests an anti-predator function because guppies are never
   found without predators. Moreover, m(Delta S) could vary with predation
   intensity within and among species. BSA can be applied to any colour
   pattern used in intraspecific and interspecific behaviour. Seven
   predictions and four questions about colour patterns are presented. In
   species which are very convex in cross-section, both chromatic and
   luminance m(Delta S) change with viewing angle; geometry of signalling
   is as important as signal geometry.}},

   population size changes from genome-wide data have been developed. At
   the same time, there has been an increasing recognition that population
   structure can generate genetic data similar to those produced under
   models of population size change. Recently, Mazet et al. (Heredity
   116:362-371, 2016) showed that, for any model of population structure,
   it is always possible to find a panmictic model with a particular
   function of population size changes, having exactly the same
   distribution of T2 (the coalescence time for a sample of size two) as
   that of the structured model. They called this function IICR (Inverse
   Instantaneous Coalescence Rate) and showed that it does not necessarily
   correspond to population size changes under non-panmictic models.
   Besides, most of the methods used to analyse data under models of
   population structure tend to arbitrarily fix that structure and to
   minimise or neglect population size changes. Here, we extend the seminal
   work of Herbots (PhD thesis, University of London, 1994) on the
   structured coalescent and propose a new framework, the Non-Stationary
   Structured Coalescent (NSSC) that incorporates demographic events
   (changes in gene flow and/or deme sizes) to models of nearly any
   complexity. We show how to compute the IICR under a wide family of
   stationary and non-stationary models. As an example we address the
   question of human and Neanderthal evolution and discuss how the NSSC
   framework allows to interpret genomic data under this new perspective.}},

  abstract                   = {{Plants are able to adjust their anti-herbivore defenses in response to
   the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by herbivore-damaged
   neighbors, and some of these changes increase resistance against
   subsequent herbivory. This phenomenon of plant-plant communication is
   thought to be widespread, but recent investigations have cautioned that
   it can be context dependent, including variation in the strength of
   communication based on the identity of plants and their associated
   herbivores. Here, we performed three greenhouse experiments using
   multiple male and female genotypes of the dioecious woody shrub
   Baccharis salicifolia and its specialist aphid Uroleucon macolai to test
   for specificity of plant-plant communication with respect to plant sex
   and genotype. Moreover, we evaluated plant sexual dimorphism and
   genotypic variation in VOC emissions (i.e., the ``speaking{''} side of
   the interaction) and response of plants to VOC exposure (i.e., the
   ``listening{''} side of the interaction) in order to identify the
   chemical mechanisms underlying such specificity. We did not find
   genotypic specificity of communication; emitter plants damaged by U.
   macolai significantly reduced subsequent U. macolai performance on
   receivers, but these effects were indistinguishable for communication
   within vs. among genotypes. In contrast, we found sex specificity of

   performance on male and female receiver plants equally, while female
   emitter plants only did so for female receivers. We found sexual (but
   not genotypic) dimorphism in speaking but not listening; of the seven
   compounds induced by U. macolai feeding (speaking), pinocarvone was
   approximately fivefold greater in female than in male plants, while
   exposure of plants to pinocarvone emissions (listening) reduced U.
   macolai performance equally in both male and female plants. Together,
   our study demonstrates novel evidence for sexually dimorphic specificity

   cost of social living. However, living in groups may also provide
   benefits that reduce the negative impacts of infection. These potential
   `tolerance' benefits of living socially are theoretically possible, but
   have rarely been described. In this study, we used an anthelmintic
   treatment experiment in wild Grant's gazelles (Nanger grati), who are
   commonly infected with gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN), to show that
   social living confers both costs and benefits related to GIN parasitism.
   We show that although larger group size increases GIN infection risk, a
   key cost of GIN infection-the suppression of food intake-is
   simultaneously moderated by living in larger groups. Our findings help
   illuminate the complex role parasites play in the evolution of host
   social behaviour.}},

   individuals that better survive in our built landscapes, that avoid our
   hunting and fishing, and that best tolerate the species that we have
   introduced. Human-altered selection pressures have also modified how

   effects can result from the host immune response to prior infection. Yet
   we lack experimental evidence that such immune-mediated priority effects
   influence epidemics. To address this research gap, we manipulated key
   host immune hormones, then measured the consequences for within-host
   parasite interactions, and ultimately parasite epidemics in the field.
   Specifically, we applied plant immune-signalling hormones to sentinel
   plants, embedded into a wild host population, and tracked foliar
   infections caused by two common fungal parasites. Within-host
   individuals, priority effects were altered by the immune-signalling
   hormone, salicylic acid (SA). Scaling up from within-host interactions,
   hosts treated with SA experienced a lower prevalence of a less
   aggressive parasite, increased burden of infection by a more aggressive
   parasite, and experienced fewer co-infections. Together, these results
   indicate that by altering within-host priority effects, host immune
   hormones can drive parasite epidemics. This study therefore
   experimentally links host immune hormones to within-host priority
   effects and parasite epidemics, advancing a more mechanistic
   understanding of how interactions among parasites alter their epidemics.}},

   food web structure, but populations are threatened by fishery
   exploitation. Sustainable management of shark populations requires
   improved understanding of migration patterns and population
   demographics, which has traditionally been sought through physical
   and/or electronic tagging studies. The application of natural tags such
   as elemental variations in mineralized band pairs of elasmobranch
   vertebrae cartilage could also reveal endogenous and exogenous processes
   experienced by sharks throughout their life histories. Here, elemental
   profiles were characterized in vertebrae encompassing complete life
   histories (birth-to-death) of shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), common
   thresher (Alopias vulpinus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) of known
   tag and recapture locations in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. All
   sharks were injected with oxytetracycline at initial capture, released
   and subsequently recaptured, with individual liberty times ranging from
   215 days to 6 years. Vertebral band pairs forming over the liberty
   intervals were verified by counting the number of band pairs deposited
   since the oxytetracycline band. Regular oscillations in vertebrae
   manganese (Mn) content corresponded well with the number of validated
   band pairs, suggesting that Mn variation could be used to age sharks.
   Increases in vertebrae barium concentration were correlated with times
   when individuals occupied areas with high coastal up welling indices,
   the timing and spatial intensity of which varied from year to year.
   Interspecific relationships were probably influenced by behavioural
   differences in horizontal and vertical habitat use, feeding habits and
   thermoregulatory physiology. These results indicate that vertebral
   sclerochronology has the potential to advance our knowledge of
   elasmobranch life history including age and growth estimation and

   To determine the tendency of specific spider taxa to be captured by the
   plant, we compared the composition (by taxonomic family) of three spider
   assemblages: those captured by the plant, those residing on or over the
   plant, and those found nearby in the local environment. Although there
   were some broad similarities within the three spider assemblages,
   significant differences existed when specific families and guilds were
   considered. While some families (e.g., Linyphiidae and Lycosidae) and
   guilds (e.g., low sheet/tangle weavers) were heavily represented in all
   three assemblages, other groups varied, and we found that the taxonomic
   makeup of victimized and resident spiders did not always reflect their
   environmental abundances. Moreover, spider assemblages captured by S.
   purpurea were extremely similar across distant locations regardless of
   environmental spider assemblage composition, suggesting that S. purpurea
   is very selective in its spider capture regimen.}},

  abstract                   = {{Phylogeny reconstruction is a key instrument in numerous biological
   analyses, ranging from evolutionary and ecology research, to
   conservation and systems biology. The increasing accumulation of genomic
   data makes it possible to reconstruct phylogenies with both high
   accuracy and at increasingly finer resolution. Yet, taking advantage of
   the enormous amount of sequence data available requires the use of
   computational tools for efficient data retrieval and processing, or else
   the process could quickly become an error-prone endeavour. Here, we
   present OneTwoTree (), a Web-based tool for tree reconstruction based on
   the supermatrix paradigm. Given a list of taxa names of interest as the
   sole input requirement, OneTwoTree retrieves all available sequence data
   from NCBI GenBank, clusters these into orthology groups, identifies the
   most informative set of markers, searches for an appropriate outgroup,
   and assembles a partitioned sequence matrix that is then used for the
   final phylogeny reconstruction step. OneTwoTree further allows users to
   control various steps of the process, such as the merging of sequences
   from similar clusters, or phylogeny reconstruction based on markers from
   a specific genome type. By comparing the performance of OneTwoTree to a
   manually reconstructed phylogeny of the Antirrhineae tribe, we show that
   the use of OneTwoTree resulted in substantially higher data coverage in
   terms of both taxon sampling and the number of informative markers
   assembled. OneTwoTree provides a flexible online tool for species-tree
   reconstruction, aimed to assist researchers ranging in their level of
   prior expertise in the task of phylogeny reconstruction.}},

  abstract                   = {{Giant saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is one of the longest-lived and
   massive cacti species in the Americas. They occur throughout the Sonoran
   Desert region with a distribution spanning a five-fold gradient in mean
   annual precipitation. Relationships between fitness traits, including
   stem growth, and spatio-temporal climate patterns are still poorly
   understood in saguaro, but are assumed to be largely coupled to summer
   precipitation. To better understand patterns of climate sensitivity in
   giant saguaro, annual stem growth, carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) in
   spine tissues, and seasonal variation in stem volume, a proxy for stem
   water storage, were evaluated over a single growing season (2014) in six
   widely distributed populations in the northern Sonoran Desert, and over
   four consecutive growing seasons (2013-2016) in two populations with
   differences in mean annual precipitation and site moisture (M-i),
   defined as precipitation amount divided by mean atmospheric vapor
   pressure deficit. We hypothesized that saguaro growth and delta C-13
   would be coupled to a complex suite of climate conditions that include
   winter precipitation and aridity. Annual stem growth of all populations
   was generally better correlated to M-i than precipitation alone and was
   best correlated with M-i measured over the hydrologic year, October
   2013-September 2014 (F = 39.8, P < 0.0001). Likewise, mean delta C-13
   increased with M-i, with the highest correlation with M-i calculated for
   July 2013-August 2014 (F = 38.4.0, P < 0.0001). Annual stem growth
   measured across all populations was well correlated to delta C-13 in
   spines produced during the current year of growth (F = 36.3, P <
   0.0001). Annual variation in stem growth appeared to reflect annual
   variation in mean stem volume measured monthly from the summer of the
   previous year to the summer of the current year of growth. Results
   suggest that stem growth and photosynthetic physiology recorded by delta
   C-13 are coupled to a complex suite of climate conditions with a strong
   legacy effect from the previous summer and winter. These findings
   provide new insight on the effects of summer and winter drought and a
   warming climate on the photosynthesis, growth, and fitness of giant
   saguaro.}},

   detection during sampling. Here, we develop a general theoretical model
   of how the probability of detecting a species in a discrete sample
   varies with its mean density in that location based on sampling
   statistics. We show that detection probability at low densities can be
   approximated with a simple one parameter saturating function: The
   probability of detection (P) should increase with the mean number of
   individuals in a discrete sample (N) as P similar to alpha N/(1 + alpha
   N). We further show how the parameter alpha will be affected by species
   spatial aggregation, within-sample observability, and gear catchability.
   We use the case of the invasive zooplankter, spiny water flea
   (Bythotrephes longimanus), to demonstrate that this theoretical model
   fits the empirical pattern of detectability. In Lake Mendota, WI,
   Bythotrephes went undetected despite rigorous long-term zooplankton
   monitoring (possibly as long as 14 yr with 15 sampling dates/yr). Using
   our modeling framework, we found that the likelihood of detecting
   Bythotrephes was low unless peak annual densities exceeded 0.1
   individuals/m(3) over multiple years. Despite using models based on
   Bythotrephes ecology to identify ways to increase detectability,
   detection probabilities remained low at low densities, such that cases
   of missed detection such as Lake Mendota are possible despite rigorous
   monitoring effort. As such, our theoretical model provides a simple rule
   of thumb for estimating sampling effort required to detect rare species
   when densities are expected to be low: The minimum samples required (S)
   to reliably detect a species can be approximated as S similar to(1 +
   N)/N.}},

  abstract                   = {{A central goal of comparative phylogeography is to understand how
   species-specific traits interact with geomorphological history to govern
   the geographic distribution of genetic variation within species. One key
   biotic trait with an immense impact on the spatial patterns of
   intraspecific genetic differentiation is dispersal. Here, we quantify
   how species-specific traits directly related to dispersal affect genetic
   variation in terrestrial organisms with adaptations for dispersal by
   sea, not land-the mangroves of the Caribbean. We investigate the
   phylogeography of white mangroves (Laguncularia racemosa, Combretaceae)
   and red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Rhizophoraceae) using chloroplast
   genomes and nuclear markers (thousands of RAD-Seq loci) from individuals
   throughout the Caribbean. Both coastal tree species have viviparous
   propagules that can float in salt water for months, meaning they are
   capable of dispersing long distances. Spatially explicit tests of the
   role of ocean currents on patterning genetic diversity revealed that
   ocean currents act as a mechanism for facilitating dispersal, but other
   means of moving genetic material are also important. We measured pollen-
   vs. propagule-mediated gene flow and discovered that in white mangroves,
   seeds were more important for promoting genetic connectivity between
   populations, but in red mangroves, the opposite was true: pollen
   contributed more. This result challenges our concept of the importance
   of both proximity to ocean currents for moving mangrove seeds and the
   extent of long-distance pollen dispersal. This study also highlights the
   importance of spatially explicit quantification of both abiotic (ocean
   currents) and biotic (dispersal) factors contributing to gene flow to
   understand fully the phylogeographic histories of species.}},

  abstract                   = {{In many terrestrial ecosystems, detritivorous soil organisms ingest
   large amounts of leaf litter returning most of it to the soil as faeces.
   Such conversion of leaf litter into faeces may stimulate decomposition
   by increasing the surface area available for microbial colonisation.
   Yet, experimental support for either the outcome or the mechanism of
   these conversion effects is lacking. Based on the hypothesis that the
   identity of plant species from which leaf litter is transformed into
   faeces has a critical role in how faeces decomposition proceeds, we
   collected faeces of the widely abundant millipede Glomeris marginata fed
   with leaf litter from seven distinct tree species. We compared the
   physical and chemical characteristics and the rates of carbon (C) and
   nitrogen (N) loss between litter and faeces. We found that after 100
   days of exposure under controlled conditions, C loss was on average
   higher in faeces (40.0\%) than that in litter (26.6\%), with a
   significant increase for six of the seven species. Concurrently, N
   dynamics switched from a net immobilisation (7.7\%) in litter to a net
   release (14.6\%) in faeces, with a significant increase for five of the
   seven species. Litter conversion into faeces generally homogenised
   differences in physical and chemical characteristics among species.
   Despite such homogenisation, variability in rates of faeces C and N loss
   among species was similar compared to leaf litter, but correlated with a
   different set of traits. Specifically, faecal pellet C loss was
   positively related to compaction (decreased specific area and increased
   density of faecal pellets), and both C and N loss from faecal pellets
   were positively related to fragmentation (increased specific area and
   perimeter of particles within faecal pellets). We conclude that litter
   fragmentation and compaction into detritivore faecal pellets lead to
   substantially enhanced decomposition, with a particularly strong impact
   on N dynamics that changed from immobilisation to net release depending
   on litter species. Moreover, litter quality control on decomposition is
   reshuffled by litter conversion into faeces. In ecosystems with high
   detritivore abundance, this so far largely overlooked pathway of organic
   matter turnover may strongly affect ecosystem C and N cycling. A is
   available for this article.}},

   with a narrow niche (specialists). We focused on spiders, as the most
   diversified group of venomous predators, in which a wide variety of
   trophic strategies have evolved. We conducted a comparative analysis
   using 40 spider species, in which we measured the size of their venom
   gland and venom complexity using proteome profiling methods. The species
   were classified into three trophic groups: generalists, facultative
   specialists and obligatory specialists. We found that the venom glands
   of generalists are larger than those of obligatory specialists, which is
   presumably due to more frequent prey capture by the former. The
   complexity of venom of peptides (2-15 kDa) and proteins (15-250 kDa) was
   more diverse in generalists than in specialists. Multivariate analysis
   of venom revealed significant differences among the three trophic
   categories only in the complexity of peptides. Our study thus shows that

  abstract                   = {{Biofilms, the complex communities of microbiota that live in association
   with aquatic interfaces, are considered to be hotspots of microbial life
   in many aquatic ecosystems. Although the importance of attached algae
   and bacteria is widely recognized, the role of the highly abundant
   biofilm-dwelling micrograzers (i.e., heterotrophic protists and small
   metazoans) is poorly understood. Studies often highlight the resistance
   of bacterial biofilms to grazing within the microbial food web and
   therefore argue that the micrograzers have a modulating role (i.e., have
   effects on biofilm phenotype) rather than a direct trophic role within
   biofilms. In the present review, we show that this view comes too short,
   and we establish a conceptual framework of biofilm food webs consisting
   of three major elements. (1) Energy pathways and subsidization from
   plankton. As inhabitants of interfaces, biofilm-dwelling grazers
   potentially access both planktonic organisms and surface-associated
   organisms. They can play an important role in importing planktonic
   production into the biofilm food web and thus in the coupling of the
   planktonic and benthic food webs. Nevertheless, specialized grazers are
   also able to utilize significant amounts of autochthonous biofilm
   production. (2) Horizontal complexity of the basal food web. While
   bacteria and algae within biofilms are edible in general, food quality
   and accessibility of both bacteria and algae can differ considerably
   between different prey phenotypes occurring during biofilm formation
   with respect to morphology, chemical defense, and nutrient
   stoichiometry. Instead of considering bacteria and algae within biofilms
   to be generally resistant to feeding by micrograzers, we suggest
   considering a horizontal food-quality axis to be at the base of biofilm
   food webs. This food quality gradient is probably associated with
   increasing costs for the micrograzers. (3) Vertical food web complexity
   and food chain length. In addition to the consumption of bacteria and
   algae, many predatory micrograzers exist within biofilm food webs. With
   the help of video microscopy, we were able to demonstrate the existence
   of a complex food web with several trophic levels within biofilms. Our
   conceptual framework should assist in integrating food web concepts and
   processes into whole-biofilm budgets and in understanding
   food-web-related interactions within biofilms.}},

   2. In central Amazonia, we recorded survival and growth (in height and
   leaf number) and damage by insect herbivores and leaf-fungal pathogens
   of Chrysophyllum pomiferum (Sapotaceae) seedlings that were exposed to
   different numbers of edges and to different distances from the forest
   edge. Grown seedlings were transplanted into one-square-metre plots
   within 1-ha blocks located in the centre (no edge), the edge (one edge),
   and the corner (two edges), and at different distances from the edge
   towards the interior (i.e., 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 m) of two
   rectangular fragments (10- and 100-ha in size). Plots were visited once
   every 2 months for 1 year (1992-1993) and thereafter every 2 years for
   almost 8 years (1993-2001).
   3. Overall, results showed that seedling survival, height, leaf number,
   and biotic damage varied over time with the presence of nearby edges and
   with the distance from the edge. Survival was lower in fragment edges
   and corners than in centres. Increase in height was similar for all
   positions within the 100-ha fragment, whereas in the 10-ha fragment
   seedling height had a greater increase at the edge and corner than in
   the centre. Furthermore, survival increased with distance from the edge
   as did leaf number, whereas height showed a lower increase closer to the
   edge than farther away.
   4. Regarding biotic damage, for both fragments herbivory was greater at
   the centres and decreased with edge proximity over time, whereas
   leaf-fungal damage was greater at the corners than in the edges and
   increased significantly over time. Biotic damage was correlated with
   seedling size. Small seedlings were more susceptible to fungal attack,
   whereas larger seedlings were so to herbivores.
   5. Synthesis. This study demonstrated that despite stochastic
   environmental factors seedling survival, growth, and biotic damage by
   herbivores and fungal pathogens varied with the level of edge exposure

   and thereby compete with others may increase with nutrient mobility.
   Hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can extend the soil volume
   from which plants acquire phosphorus (P), thus increasing competition
   for these resources with neighbours. In this study, we tested whether
   the suppression of hyphal interconnections between neighbour plants
   mitigates their competitive interactions and consequently affects plant
   community structure. We used custom-built microcosms that used a wire
   system to suppress the development of a common mycorrhizal network (CMN)
   between plant neighbours. We applied this CMN treatment to plants
   without neighbours (competition-free controls), with conspecific
   neighbours (monocultures) or with heterospecific neighbours (two and
   four species communities), all assembled from two pools of four separate
   temperate grassland species each. We analysed changes in species and
   community-level productivity and P acquisition. The CMN treatment
   affected species differently. Most species had reduced shoot biomass
   while root biomass increased with CMN disconnection. Productivity and
   nutrient acquisition of Plantago lanceolata in four-species mixtures was
   negatively affected, leading to a less even distribution of P among
   species, but community-level P acquisition was not affected. On average,
   two-species and four-species mixtures produced similar community biomass
   and had the same P content as monocultures.Synthesis. Common mycorrhizal
   network disconnection affected competitive interactions among species
   only little. One explanation may be that the absence of pronounced
   competitive hierarchy among the species investigated led to relatively
   symmetric interactions among species that were stable with respects to
   additional common mycorrhizal network effects. Another explanation is
   that common mycorrhizal network effects are less important in natural
   soils with natural arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities than
   experiments with few arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strains and often
   sterilized soils suggest.}},

   change on wildlife populations therefore requires a thorough
   understanding of the mechanisms through which different environmental
   drivers interact to generate changes in population size and structure.
   In this study, we disentangled the roles of temperature, food
   availability and population density in shaping short- and long-term
   population dynamics of the African striped mouse, a small rodent
   inhabiting a semidesert with high intra- and interannual variation in
   environmental conditions. We parameterized a female-only
   stage-structured matrix population model with vital rates depending on
   temperature, food availability and population density, using monthly
   mark-recapture data from 1609 mice trapped over 9years (2005-2014). We
   then applied perturbation analyses to determine relative strengths and
   demographic pathways of these drivers in affecting population dynamics.
   Furthermore, we used stochastic population projections to gain insights
   into how three different climate change scenarios might affect size,
   structure and persistence of this population. We identified food
   availability, acting through reproduction, as the main driver of changes
   in both short- and long-term population dynamics. This mechanism was
   mediated by strong density feedbacks, which stabilized the population
   after high peaks and allowed it to recover from detrimental crashes.
   Density dependence thus buffered the population against environmental
   change, and even adverse climate change scenarios were predicted to have
   little effect on population persistence (extinction risk over 100years
   <5\%) despite leading to overall lower abundances. Explicitly linking
   environment-demography relationships to population dynamics allowed us
   to accurately capture past population dynamics. It further enabled
   establishing the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and
   intrinsic environmental drivers, and we conclude that doing this is
   essential when investigating impacts of climate change on wildlife
   populations.}},

   species conservation. In the northeast Atlantic Ocean, recent changes
   amongst seabird communities are linked to human and climate change
   impacts on food webs. Many species have declined severely, with food
   shortages, and increased predation reducing productivity. Arctic skua
   Stercorarius parasiticus, a kleptoparasite of other seabirds, is one
   such species. The aim of the study was to determine relative effects of
   bottom-up and top-down pressures on Arctic skuas across multiple
   colonies in a rapidly declining national population. Long-term
   monitoring data were used to quantify changes in population size and
   productivity of Arctic skuas, their hosts (black-legged kittiwake Rissa
   tridactyla, common guillemot Uria aalge, Atlantic puffin Fratercula
   arctica, Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea) and an apex predator (great skua
   Stercorarius skua) over 24years (1992-2015) in Scotland. We used digital
   mapping and statistical models to determine relative effects of
   bottom-up (host productivity) and top-down (great skua density)
   pressures on Arctic skuas across 33 colonies, and assess variation
   between three colony types classified by host abundance. Arctic skuas
   declined by 81\% and their hosts by 42\%-92\%, whereas at most colonies
   great skuas increased. Annual productivity declined in Arctic skuas and
   their hosts, and reduced Arctic skua breeding success was a driver of
   the species' population decline. Arctic skua productivity was positively
   associated with annual breeding success of hosts and negatively with
   great skua density. Intercolony variation suggested Arctic skua trends
   and productivity were most sensitive to top-down pressures at smaller
   colonies of host species where great skuas had increased most, whereas
   bottom-up pressures dominated at large colonies of host species.
   Scotland's Arctic skua population is declining rapidly, with bottom-up
   and top-down pressures simultaneously reducing breeding success to
   unsustainably low levels. Marine food web alterations, strongly
   influenced by fisheries management and climate change, are driving the
   decline, and this study demonstrates severe vulnerability of seabirds to
   rapid change in human-modified ecosystems. Potential but untested
   conservation solutions for Arctic skuas include marine protected areas,
   supplementary feeding within colonies and management of great skuas.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. In Europe, agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been unsuccessful in
   halting biodiversity declines to any great extent. Two shortcomings of
   AES include the low farm uptake and the modest efficacy of many AES
   options. Partly in response to these shortcomings, initiatives
   encouraging farmers to take an active role in biodiversity conservation
   have gained in popularity. However, almost no evaluations of such
   initiatives exist.
   2. We evaluated uptake of conservation advice on farms in the Swedish
   Volunteer \& Farmer Alliance, a BirdLife Sweden-coordinated project
   aimed at farmland bird conservation, and the response of farmland birds
   to those actions using farm-level survey data, in a before-after
   implementation assessment.
   3. Uptake was higher for unsubsidised (i.e. non-AES) measures than for
   AES options, and depended mainly on farmers' interest in nature, with
   farm size and production type having less importance.
   4. In general, abundances of non-crop nesting and field-nesting bird
   species declined between inventory years (median interval 3 years).
   Decreases were more marked in agriculturally marginal regions than in
   more arable-dominated regions, and declines were stronger on organic
   than on conventional farms.
   5. Negative abundance trends among non-crop nesting species were reduced
   by an increasing number of conservation measures at the farm, but only
   in the more arable-dominated landscapes. Changes in field-nesting
   species, or at species level, did not significantly relate to
   implemented measures, but the power to detect such effects was generally
   small due to the small sample size of high-uptake farms as well as high
   inter-farm variability.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that volunteer farmer
   alliances and the addition of unsubsidised measures may be successful in
   changing the local number of non-crop nesting farmland birds, at the
   farm level, particularly in intensively managed agricultural landscapes.
   Thus, unsubsidised measures can be a useful addition to the set of
   agri-environment tools, although their effects on breeding bird numbers
   are (as with agri-environmental schemes) dependent on landscape context,
   as well as on ensuring high on-farm uptake of different interventions.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Recreational fisheries are traditionally managed at local scales, but
   more effective management could be achieved using a cross-scale
   approach. To do this, we must first understand how local processes scale
   up to influence landscape patterns between anglers and resources. We
   highlight how population-based synchrony methods, used in conjunction
   with a complex-adaptive-systems framework, can reveal emergent spatial
   properties within social-ecological systems such as recreational
   fisheries.
   2. Herein, we quantified the level of spatial synchrony in angler
   behaviour, defined the relationship between angler synchrony and
   distance among waterbodies, and highlighted social-ecological attributes
   contributing to these patterns. We leveraged a 111 waterbody-year (34
   waterbodies, 5-year collection period) recreational fisheries dataset
   from Nebraska, USA to address these objectives.
   3. Intra-annual patterns in angler behaviour were moderately synchronous
   across large spatial scales and predominately unrelated to distance
   among waterbodies. Large-scale synchronous patterns in angler behaviour
   emerged from local-scale interactions between angler heterogeneity and
   waterbody diversity.
   4. Spatial synchrony in angler behaviour is an emergent property that
   resulted from local-level processes that scaled up to form large-scale
   patterns. We posit that angler utility in combination with waterbodies
   sharing these desired utility components caused spatial synchrony among
   anglers with similar preferences or specializations. The level of
   spatial synchrony in angler behaviour will therefore depend on the
   degree of angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity on the landscape,
   with high or low levels of both leading to low and high levels of
   spatial synchrony respectively.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Synchrony-based methods proved useful for
   unveiling an emergent property in recreational fisheries that is
   beneficial for effective cross-scale management. It may not be
   appropriate to extrapolate information and apply uniform management
   actions among local waterbodies because angler behaviour was not
   synchronous at small scales. Rather, anglers respond uniquely to
   waterbody diversity and therefore substitute waterbodies may be
   dispersed throughout the landscape. Creating boat access, for example
   could yield unintended consequences for a particular angler group and
   cause local and regional shifts in angler behaviour. Evaluating
   appropriate management options will require a cross-scale monitoring
   approach that captures angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity at
   multiple scales.}},

   to fisheries management. Combating illegal, unreported and unregulated
   fishing and the regulation of area-based management through physical
   patrols and port side controls are growing areas of management
   attention. Augmenting the existing approaches to fisheries management
   with forensic techniques has the potential to increase compliance and
   enforcement success rates.
   2. We tested the accuracy of three techniques (genotyping, otolith
   microchemistry and morphometrics) that can be used to identify
   geographic origin. We used fish caught from three fishing grounds,
   separated by a minimum of 5 km and a maximum of 60 km, to test the
   accuracy of these approaches at relatively small spatial scales.
   3. Using nearest-neighbour analyses, morphometric analysis was the most
   accurate (79.5\%) in assigning individual fish to their fishing ground
   of origin. Neither otolith microchemistry (54.0\%) or genetic analyses
   (52.4\%) had sufficient accuracy at the spatial scales we examined.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The combination of accuracy and minimal
   resource requirements make morphometric analysis a promising tool for
   assessing compliance with area-based fishing restrictions at the scale
   of kilometres. Furthermore, this approach has promising application, in
   small-scale fisheries through to community-based management approaches
   where technical and financial resources are limited.}},

   Although there is now evidence that olfaction plays a greater role in
   primate social life than previously assumed, research on the sense of
   smell in non-human apes is scarce. Chimpanzees sniff the ground and
   vegetation on boundary patrols, but the function of this behaviour is
   unclear. Since chimpanzees are highly territorial and can kill
   individuals that do not belong to their own community, sniffing might
   function to gather information about conspecifics, particularly
   concerning group membership and kinship. To investigate whether
   chimpanzees recognize group members and kin via olfactory cues, we
   conducted behavioural bioassays on two groups of chimpanzees at Leipzig
   Zoo. In a pilot study, we found that chimpanzees responded more strongly
   to urine than to faeces or body odour. We then presented urine from
   group members, outgroup individuals and an unscented control in aerated
   boxes using a simultaneous discrimination task. The first behaviour
   after a chimpanzee first approached a box was related to olfaction
   (sniffing, nose within 20 cm, licking) in 83\% of cases, highlighting
   the importance of olfaction as a general investigation mechanism in this
   species. Chimpanzees sniffed significantly longer at urine stimuli than
   the control and significantly longer at odours from outgroup individuals
   than those from group members. Furthermore, the duration of sniffing was
   positively correlated with relatedness. Our results suggest that
   chimpanzees use olfactory cues to obtain information about social
   relationships and fill a gap in our understanding of primate chemical
   communication.}},

   thereby buffering against variable resource densities (termed `portfolio
   effects', PEs). However, whether variation among species or locations
   represent the dominant contributor to PE remains relatively unexplored.
   Here, we apply a spatio-temporal model to multidecadal time series
   (1982-2015) for 20 bottom-associated fishes in seven marine ecosystems.
   For each ecosystem, we compute the reduction in variance over time in
   total biomass relative to its theoretical maximum if species and
   locations were perfectly correlated (total PE). We also compute the
   reduction in variance due to asynchrony among species at each location
   (species PE) or the reduction due to asynchrony among locations for each
   species (spatial PE). We specifically compute total, species and spatial
   PE in 10-year moving windows to detect changes over time. Our analyses
   revealed that spatial PE are stronger than species PE in six of seven
   ecosystems, and that ecosystems where species PE is constant over time
   can exhibit shifts in locations that strongly contribute to PE. We

  abstract                   = {{Phenological shifts have been observed in a wide range of taxa, but the
   fitness consequences of these shifts are largely unknown, and we often
   lack experimental studies to assess their population-level and
   evolutionary consequences. Here, we describe an experimental study to
   determine the fitness consequences of phenological shifts in blue
   orchard bee (Osmia lignaria) emergence, compare the measured seasonal
   fitness landscape with observed phenology in the unmanipulated
   population, and assess seasonal variation in key factors related to
   reproduction, foraging, and brood parasitism that were expected to
   affect the shape of the fitness landscape. By tracking individually
   marked females, we were able to estimate the lifetime fitness impacts of
   phenological advances and delays. We also measured parasitism risk,
   floral resource use, and nesting behavior to understand how each varies
   seasonally, and their combined effects on realized fitness. Survival to
   nesting decreased non-monotonically throughout the season, with a 20.4\%
   decline in survival rates between the first and second cohorts. The
   total reproductive output per maternal bee was 14.9\% higher in the
   second cohort compared to the first, and 161\% higher in the second
   cohort compared to the third. Combining seasonal patterns in survival
   and reproductive output, experimentally advanced females showed 30.6\%
   higher fitness than bees released at the historic peak. In contrast, the
   nesting phenology of unmanipulated bees showed nearly equal numbers of
   nesting attempts in the first two cohorts. Both increased resource
   availability and reduced parasitism risk favored earlier emergence.
   These results are consistent with a population experiencing directional
   selection for earlier emergence, adaptive bet-hedging, or developmental
   constraints. Our study offers insight into the fitness consequences of
   phenological shifts, the mechanisms affecting the fitness consequences
   of phenological shifts in a community context, and the potential for
   adaptive responses to climate change.}},

  abstract                   = {{The satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is
   commonly used by researchers and managers to represent ungulate forage
   conditions in landscapes across the globe, despite limited information
   about how it compares to empirical measurements of forage quality and
   quantity. The application of NDVI as a forage metric is particularly
   appealing for studying migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in remote
   Arctic ecosystems, where field assessments are logistically and
   financially prohibitive, and climate-mediated changes in vegetation have
   been hypothesized to influence population declines. To determine the
   utility of NDVI for adequately representing caribou forage conditions,
   we compared NDVI derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery to empirical measures of
   caribou forage biomass, nitrogen, digestible nitrogen, and digestible
   energy within the summer range of the Central Arctic Caribou Herd on the
   North Slope of Alaska. Specifically, we determined the strength of
   forage-NDVI relationships at the start of the growing season and across
   the summer, assessed the efficacy of NDVI variables for modeling
   spatiotemporal variation in field measurements of different forage
   components, and used long-term MODIS data to estimate temporal changes
   in forage between 2000 and 2016. We found that NDVI values were weakly
   correlated with caribou forage quality at the start of the growing
   season and throughout the summer. Although linear models of forage-NDVI
   relationships performed poorly, NDVI variables (NDVI and the number of
   days from when NDVI reached its maximum value) were useful for modeling
   spatiotemporal variation in empirical measurements of forage components
   across the growing season, but only when we incorporated nonlinear
   forage-NDVI relationships and other habitat covariates. Phenological
   advances in the date of peak NDVI were associated with significant
   changes in forage conditions, particularly nitrogen, which exhibited
   earlier seasonal declines. Using long-term MODIS data, predicted values
   of forage nitrogen declined between 2000 and 2016, driven by exceedingly
   low values in 2014 and 2015. Given our results, we caution the
   application of NDVI as a general (linear) proxy of caribou forage
   conditions across the growing season, and encourage practitioners to use
   NDVI variables to model spatiotemporal variation in specific forage
   conditions from empirical field data, accounting for nonlinear
   forage-NDVI relationships.}},

  abstract                   = {{In 2011, east Texas experienced the worst drought on record causing
   extensive tree mortality. Initial mortality estimates for 2012 varied
   among tree genera. A rapid damage assessment (RDA) estimated that 65.5
   (+/- 7.3) million trees died as a result of the drought in this region
   one year post-drought. However, this estimate was untested against
   established monitoring networks. Moreover, pests and physiological
   damage can elevate tree mortality multiple years beyond a drought event.
   Since the RDA was unable to quantify multi-year trends, it remained
   unclear whether these drivers caused increased tree mortality in east
   Texas beyond one year post-drought and how different species responded
   over time. To address these questions, we compared total 2012 standing
   dead tree (SDT) estimates (i.e., drought-killed plus all other SDT
   excluding harvested or salvaged trees) derived from the RDA and U.S.
   Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data for east Texas.
   Total SDT estimates did not significantly differ between the RDA (120.5
   +/- 8.5 million) and FIA (108.4 +/- 8.7 million). Furthermore, total SDT
   estimates for the four most common genera (Pinus, Quercus, Liquidambar,
   Ulmus), which comprised over 80\% of all species, did not significantly
   differ between the RDA and FIA. Additionally, we used logistic
   regression and FIA data from east Texas for 2011 through four years
   post-drought (2012-2015) to examine temporal trends in plot-level
   drought- and pest-driven tree mortality of seven key species (Pinus
   taeda, Pinus echinata, Quercus nigra, Quercus stellata, Quercus falcata,
   Liquidambar styraciflua, Ulmus alata) from the four most common genera.
   At the plot-level, drought-driven mortality was immediate for the three
   Quercus species (notably Q. falcata) and L. styraciflua which
   significantly increased in 2012 while P. taeda mortality was delayed,
   not increasing significantly until 2013. Pest-driven mortality increased
   from 2013 to 2015 for all species, with the highest mortality observed
   in Q. falcata and lowest in P. taeda and U. alata. This study affirms
   the validity and value of independent sampling efforts to quantify
   mortality immediately following major disturbance and also demonstrates
   the need for longer-term species-level assessments beyond the initial
   year post-drought to account for differential impacts from drought and
   pests.}},

   genetic diversity and the dominant structuring forces, particularly near
   range limits, where climatic variation can drive rapid expansions or
   contractions of geographic range. Here, we examine population structure
   and landscape associations in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) across a
   heterogeneous landscape near the northern range limit in Labrador,
   Canada. Analysis of two amplicon-based data sets containing 101
   microsatellites and 376 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 35
   locations revealed clear differentiation between populations spawning in
   rivers flowing into a large marine embayment (Lake Melville) compared to
   coastal populations. The mechanisms influencing the differentiation of
   embayment populations were investigated using both multivariate and
   machine-learning landscape genetic approaches. We identified temperature
   as the strongest correlate with genetic structure, particularly warm
   temperature extremes and wider annual temperature ranges. The genomic
   basis of this divergence was further explored using a subset of
   locations (n=17) and a 220K SNP array. SNPs associated with spatial
   structuring and temperature mapped to a diverse set of genes and
   molecular pathways, including regulation of gene expression, immune
   response, and cell development and differentiation. The results spanning
   molecular marker types and both novel and established methods clearly
   show climate-associated, fine-scale population structure across an
   environmental gradient in Atlantic salmon near its range limit in North

   responses to climate change and managing species sustainability.}},

   natural variation in stomata size and density contributes to resolve
   trade-offs between carbon uptake and water loss in response to local
   climatic variation is not yet understood. We developed an automated
   confocal microscopy approach to characterize natural genetic variation
   in stomatal patterning in 330 fully sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana
   accessions collected throughout the European range of the species. We
   compared this to variation in water-use efficiency, measured as carbon
   isotope discrimination (C-13). We detect substantial genetic variation
   for stomata size and density segregating within Arabidopsis thaliana. A
   positive correlation between stomata size and C-13 further suggests that
   this variation has consequences on water-use efficiency. Genome wide
   association analyses indicate a complex genetic architecture underlying
   not only variation in stomatal patterning but also to its covariation
   with carbon uptake parameters. Yet, we report two novel QTL affecting
   C-13 independently of stomatal patterning. This suggests that, in A.
   thaliana, both morphological and physiological variants contribute to
   genetic variance in water-use efficiency. Patterns of regional
   differentiation and covariation with climatic parameters indicate that
   natural selection has contributed to shape some of this variation,
   especially in Southern Sweden, where water availability is more limited
   in spring relative to summer. These conditions are expected to favour
   the evolution of drought avoidance mechanisms over drought escape

   interactions and rates of nutrient cycling within ecosystems. However,
   we still know little about either the underlying causes of these
   stoichiometric differences or the consistency of these differences
   across large geographical extents.
   2. Here, we analyse elemental (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) composition
   of 872 aquatic macroinvertebrates (71 species) inhabiting tank
   bromeliads (n=140) from five distantly located sites across Central and
   South America to (i) test phylogenetic, trophic and body size scaling
   explanations for why organisms differ in elemental composition and (ii)
   determine whether patterns in elemental composition are universal or
   context dependent.
   3. Taxonomy explained most variance in elemental composition, even
   though phylogenetic signals were weak and limited to regional spatial
   extents and to the family level. The highest elemental contents and
   lowest carbon:nutrient ratios were found in organisms at high trophic
   levels and with smaller body size, regardless of geographical location.
   4. Carnivores may have higher nutrient content and lower carbon:nutrient
   ratios than their prey, as organisms optimize growth by choosing the
   most nutrient-rich resources to consume and then preferentially retain
   nutrients over carbon in their bodies. Smaller organisms grow
   proportionally faster than large organisms and so are predicted to have
   higher nutrient requirements to fuel RNA and protein synthesis.
   Geography influenced the magnitude, more than the direction, of the
   ecological and/or phylogenetic effects on elemental composition.
   5. Overall, our results show that both ecological (i.e. trophic group)
   and evolutionary drivers explain among-taxa variation in the elemental
   content of invertebrates, whereas intraspecific variation is mainly a
   function of body size. Our findings also demonstrate that restricting
   analyses of macroinvertebrate stoichiometry solely to either the local
   scale or species level affects inferences of the patterns in
   invertebrate elemental content and their underlying mechanisms.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Binomial N-mixture models are commonly applied to analyse population
   survey data. By estimating detection probabilities, N-mixture models aim
   at extracting information about abundances in terms of absolute and not
   just relative numbers. This separation of detection probability and
   abundance relies on parametric assumptions about the distribution of
   individuals among sites and of detections of individuals among repeat
   visits to sites. Current methods for checking assumptions are limited,
   and their computational complexity has hindered evaluations of their
   performance.
   2. We use simulations and a case study to assess the sensitivity of
   binomial N-mixture models to overdispersion in abundance and in
   detection, develop computationally efficient graphical goodness of fit
   checks to detect it, and evaluate the ability of the checks to identify
   overdispersion.
   3. The simulations show that if the parametric assumptions are not exact
   the bias in estimated abundances can be severe: underestimation if there
   is overdispersion in abundance relative to the fitted model and
   overestimation if there is overdispersion in detection. Our
   goodness-of-fit checks performed well in detecting lack of fit when the
   abundance distribution was overdispersed, but struggled to detect lack
   of fit when detections were overdispersed. We show that the inability to
   detect lack of fit due to overdispersed detection is caused by a
   fundamental similarity between N-mixture models with beta-binomial
   detections and N-mixture models with negative binomial abundances.
   4. The strong biases that can occur in the binomial N-mixture model when
   the distribution of individuals among sites, or the detection model, is
   mis-specified implies that checking goodness of fit is essential for
   sound inference about abundance. To check the assumptions we provide
   computationally efficient goodness of fit checks that are available in
   an R-package nmixgof. However, even when a binomial N-mixture model
   appears to fit the data well, estimates are not robust in the presence
   of overdispersion. We show that problems can occur even when estimated
   detection probabilities are high, and that previously reported problems
   with negative binomial models cannot always be diagnosed by checking the
   sensitivity of abundance estimates to numerical cutoff values used in
   likelihood computations.}},

   drivers such as water availability. Climate change will lead to
   increases in drought severity and frequency, but how canopy nutrients
   will respond to drought, and how these responses may vary with community
   composition along aridity gradients is poorly understood. We
   experimentally addressed this issue by reducing precipitation amounts by
   66\% during two consecutive growing seasons at three sites located along
   a natural aridity gradient. This allowed us to assess drought effects on
   canopy nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in arid and
   semiarid grasslands of northern China. Along the aridity gradient,
   canopy nutrient concentrations were positively related to aridity, with
   this pattern was driven primarily by species turnover (i.e., an increase
   in the relative biomass of N- and P-rich species with increasing
   aridity). In contrast, drought imposed experimentally increased N but
   decreased P concentrations in plant canopies. These changes were driven
   by the combined effects of species turnover and intraspecific variation
   in leaf nutrient concentrations. In addition, the sensitivity of canopy
   N and P concentrations to drought varied across the three sites. Canopy
   nutrient concentrations were less affected by drought at drier than
   wetter sites, because of the opposing effects of species turnover and
   intraspecific variation, as well as greater drought tolerance for
   nutrient-rich species. These contrasting effects of long-term aridity
   vs. short-term drought on canopy nutrient concentrations, as well as
   differing sensitivities among sites in the same grassland biome,
   highlight the challenge of predicting ecosystem responses to future

   the ecological variation of energy metabolism in endotherms is the
   apparent negative correlation between ambient temperature and
   mass-independent basal metabolic rate (residual BMR). As a consequence,
   ambient temperature has been considered the most important external
   factor driving the evolution of residual BMR. It is not clear, however,
   whether this relationship is size dependent, and artifacts such as the
   biased sampling of body masses in physiological data sets could cause us
   to overstate the ubiquity of the relationship. Accordingly, here we used
   published data on body mass (m(b)), BMR, and annual mean temperature
   (Tmean) for 458 mammal species (and/or subspecies) to examine the size
   dependence of the relationship between temperature and BMR. We found a
   significant interaction between m(b) and Tmean as predictors of residual
   BMR, such that the effect of Tmean on residual BMR decreases as a
   function of m(b). In line with this, the amount of residual variance in
   BMR explained by Tmean decreased with increasing m(b), from 20\%-30\% at
   body sizes of less than 100 g to almost 0 at body sizes greater than
   1,000 g. These data suggest that our current understanding of the
   importance of broad-scale variation in ambient temperature as a driver
   of metabolic evolution in endotherms probably is affected by the large
   number of small species in both nature and physiological data sets.}},

   governs trophic interactions. Although this is an appealing theoretical
   concept, predator-prey size ratios (PPSRs) vary strikingly across and
   within natural food webs, meaning that predators deviate from their
   optimal prey size by consuming relatively larger or smaller prey. Here
   we suggest that this unexpected variation in allometric scaling of
   trophic interactions can be predicted by gradients of prey limitation
   consistent with predictions from optimal foraging theory. We analyzed
   >6,000 trophic interactions of 52 populations from four tropical frog
   species along a gradient of prey limitation. The mean of PPSR and its
   variance differed up to two orders of magnitude across and within food
   webs. Importantly, as prey availability decreased across food webs, PPSR
   and its variance became more size dependent. Thus, trophic interactions
   did not follow a fixed allometric scaling but changed predictably with
   the strength of prey limitation. Our results emphasize the importance of
   ecological contexts in arranging food webs and the need to incorporate
   ecological drivers of PPSR and its variance in food web and community
   models.}},

   as either an equalizing or a stabilizing mechanism of coexistence, but
   the effect of the symbiosis likely depends on the responsiveness to
   fungi of plant species within a community, rather than simply as a
   binary metric based on presence or absence of AM fungi. Here, we test
   the hypothesis that communities consisting of plants that are
   unresponsive to mycorrhiza, or that differ widely in their response to
   mycorrhiza, would exhibit larger differences in their niche and fitness
   resulting to weaker plant-plant competition.
   2. We took two complementary approaches to test our hypotheses: first,
   we reanalysed data from the classic ``BIODEPTH{''} grassland
   biodiversity manipulation experiment to assess niche and relative
   fitness differences of plant communities solely comprising species
   considered to be either obligate or facultative symbiotrophs. Second, we
   assembled replicate synthetic plant communities comprising all 70
   possible four-species mixtures from a pool of eight species in the
   presence of an AM fungus to assess pairwise competition coefficients and
   infer coexistence potential. The species were characteristic of
   pastures, had an identical CSR survival strategy, and in nature differ
   in their extent of colonization by AM fungi. We separately established
   monocultures to estimate competition coefficients and assess plant
   responsiveness to mycorrhiza.
   3. Analysis of data from BIODEPTH showed that plant communities
   comprising solely species with obligate associations with AM fungi had
   greater niche and fitness differences compared with communities
   comprising species without obligate associations with AM fungi. In the
   manipulation experiment, we found that plants that depended on AM fungi
   competed more strongly than plants with little dependence on AM fungi.
   The weakest competition was between AM-responsive and AM-unresponsive
   plant species. Coexistence was more likely in pairwise combinations in
   which at least one of the plant species responded negatively to
   mycorrhiza.
   4. Synthesis. We directly quantified variation in niche and fitness
   differences between plant species due to interaction with AM fungi.
   Integrating this knowledge into explicit competition models in plant
   community ecology could greatly enhance our ability to predict
   coexistence in nature.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two important
   characteristics of alpine plants to overcome the threats caused by
   global changes. Among alpine species, Arabis alpina is characterised by
   an unusually wide altitudinal amplitude, ranging from 800 to 3,100 m of
   elevation in the French Alps. Two non-exclusive hypotheses can explain
   the presence of A. alpina across this broad ecological gradient:
   adaptive phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation, making this species
   especially useful to better understand these phenomena in alpine plant
   species.
   2. We carried out common garden experiments at two different elevations
   with maternal progenies from six sites that differed in altitude. We
   showed that (1) key phenotypic traits (morphotype, total fruit length,
   growth, height) display significant signs of local adaptation, (2) most
   traits studied are characterised by a high phenotypic plasticity between
   the two experimental gardens and (3) the two populations from the
   highest elevations lacked morphological plasticity compared to the other
   populations.
   3. By combining two genome scan approaches (detection of selection and
   association methods), we isolated a candidate gene (Sucrose-Phosphate
   Synthase 1). This gene was associated with height and local average
   temperature in our studied populations, consistent with previous studies
   on this gene in Arabidopsis thaliana.
   4. Synthesis. Given the nature of the traits involved in the detected
   pattern of local adaptation and the relative lack of plasticity of the
   two most extreme populations, our findings are consistent with a
   scenario of a locally adaptive stress response syndrome in high
   elevation populations. Due to a reduced phenotypic plasticity, an
   overall low intra-population genetic diversity of the adaptive traits
   and weak gene flow, populations of high altitude might have difficulties
   to cope with, e.g. a rise of temperature.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Aggregated distributions of parasite individuals across host
   individuals are nearly ubiquitous among parasitic taxa. The size and sex
   ratio of the population of one parasite species infecting a single host
   (hereafter ``infrapopulation{''}) can influence parasite fitness through
   intraspecific competition, mate availability and the ability to attract
   vectors for transmission of parasite propagules. Competition for
   resources and for pollen and seed vector services may limit reproductive
   success (pollen receipt, fruit production and seed dispersal) in large
   infrapopulations of parasitic plants, while mate limitation or reduced
   ability to attract vectors may limit this success in small
   infrapopulations.
   2. Using a dioecious parasitic plant, desert mistletoe Phoradendron
   californicum, we experimentally removed reproductive tissue from male
   parasites in whole infrapopulations to test for independent effects of
   infrapopulation size and within-host mate availability on female
   fitness. As desert mistletoe requires both pollen and seed vectors for
   successful reproduction, the species provides the opportunity to test
   how infrapopulation characteristics affect multiple components of
   parasite fitness.
   3. We found that insect-mediated pollen receipt decreased for parasites
   on treated hosts, consistent with within-host mate limitation.
   Additionally, the relationship between mate availability and fruit
   production per flower ranged from neutral to positive depending on year
   of the experiment.
   4. As expected if competition for host resources limits reproductive
   success more than mate availability in larger infrapopulations, the
   greater pollen receipt to females in large infrapopulations did not
   generally translate into increased mistletoe fruit production.
   Relationships between mistletoe fruit production per flower and
   infrapopulation size ranged from negative to neutral.
   5. Both pollen receipt and pollinator visitation increased with
   infrapopulation size, indicating that larger populations can be more
   attractive to pollen vectors independent of mate availability. However,
   we found no relationship between infrapopulation size and fruit removal
   by dispersers and, thus, no evidence that attraction of seed dispersal
   vectors increases with infrapopulation size.
   6. Synthesis. These results highlight the interactive roles of
   within-host processes (resource competition, mate availability and
   vector attraction) in determining the fitness of biotically transmitted
   parasite individuals.}},

  abstract                   = {{Invasion and dominance of exotic grasses and increased fire frequency
   threaten native ecosystems worldwide. In the Great Basin region of the
   western United States, woody and herbaceous fuel treatments are
   implemented to decrease the effects of wildfire and increase sagebrush
   (Artemisia spp.) ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to
   exotic annual grasses. High cover of the exotic annual cheatgrass
   (Bromus tectorum) after treatments increases fine fuels, which in turn
   increases the risk of passing over a biotic threshold to a state of
   increased wildfire frequency and conversion to cheatgrass dominance.
   Sagebrush ecosystem resilience to wildfire and resistance to cheatgrass
   depend on climatic conditions and abundance of perennial herbaceous
   species that compete with cheatgrass. In this study, we used longer-term
   data to evaluate the relationships among soil climate conditions,
   perennial herbaceous cover, and cheatgrass cover following fuel
   management treatments across the environmental gradients that
   characterize sagebrush ecosystems in the Great Basin. We examined the
   effects of woody and herbaceous fuel treatments on soil temperature,
   soil water availability (13-30 and 50 cm depths), and native and exotic
   plant cover on six sagebrush sites lacking pinon (Pinus spp.) or juniper
   (Juniperus spp.) tree expansion and 11 sagebrush sites with tree
   expansion. Both prescribed fire and mechanical treatments increased soil
   water availability on woodland sites and perennial herbaceous cover on
   some woodland and sagebrush sites. Prescribed fire also slightly
   increased soil temperatures and especially increased cheatgrass cover
   compared to no treatment and mechanical treatments on most sites.
   Non-metric dimensional scaling ordination and decision tree partition
   analysis indicated that sites with warmer late springs and warmer and
   wetter falls had higher cover of cheatgrass. Sites with wetter winters
   and early springs (March-April) had higher cover of perennial herbs. Our
   findings suggest that site resistance to cheatgrass after fire and fuel
   control treatments decreases with a warmer and drier climate. This
   emphasizes the need for management actions to maintain and enhance
   perennial herb cover, such as implementing appropriate grazing
   management, and revegetating sites that have low abundance of perennial
   herbs in conjunction with fuel control treatments.}},

   populations is a foundational goal of evolutionary biology. To this end,
   population geneticists have developed a variety of models that can
   produce stable polymorphisms. In one of the earliest models, Owen (1953)
   demonstrated that differences in selection pressures acting on males and
   females could maintain multiple alleles of a gene at a stable
   equilibrium. If the selection pressures act in opposite directions in
   males and females, we refer to this as (inter-) sexual conflict or
   sexual antagonism (Arnqvist \& Rowe, 2005). Testing if sexual conflict
   maintains genetic variation in natural populations is a tremendous
   challengeit requires both identifying loci that harbor sexually
   antagonistic alleles and determining whether those alleles are
   maintained as stable polymorphisms (Mank, 2017). Doing so genome-wide is
   even harder because it is not tractable to identify sexually
   antagonistic alleles and test for stable polymorphisms at all loci.
   Dutoit etal. (2018) confront this challenge in a paper published in this
   issue of Molecular Ecology. Using gene expression and population genomic
   data from the collared flycatcher, Dutoit etal. (2018) identify

   offspring survival in altrical species. Infanticide by novel males
   results in loss of maternal investment, and maternal strategies have
   evolved to mitigate these losses. One such maternal strategy, the Bruce
   effect, involves spontaneous abortion by females of some mammal species
   when exposed to a novel male during pregnancy.
   2. In mice, the Bruce effect only occurs during early pregnancy, but we
   have previously found that female mice exposed to a novel male's scent
   in late pregnancy weaned smaller offspring. Here, we replicate that
   manipulation to resolve the cause of the reduced weaning weight and
   subsequent effects on offspring fitness.
   3. Females exposed to an unfamiliar male's scent in late pregnancy spent
   significantly less time nursing their pups during lactation, suggesting
   that reduced maternal allocation contributes to slower offspring growth.
   The offspring with a reduced weaning weight exhibited catch-up growth
   and reached a normal weight at adulthood. These offspring, however, were
   found to bear oxidative damage in adulthood, revealing long-term effects
   on offspring condition.
   4. We conclude that female mice strategically alter their investment in
   lactation in relation to the likelihood of infanticide, but that this
   results in long-term fitness costs to their offspring.}},

   in nutrient requirements provide a powerful basis for predictive
   ecological models, and yet, such responses are virtually unstudied in
   the wild.
   2. We tested for macronutrient-specific compensatory feeding responses
   by free-ranging golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana)
   inhabiting high altitude temperate forests, where they experience a
   substantial difference in ambient temperature in cold winters vs. warmer
   springs. The monkeys had free access to natural foods throughout the
   year, and to ensure that any seasonal differences in nutrient intake
   were due to homeostatic compensation and not constraints on food
   availability, we studied the monkeys during periods in which they were
   provisioned with the same amount of supplementary foods in winter and
   spring.
   3. Thermoregulatory energy costs in winter and spring were calculated
   using partitional calorimetric estimations of convective and radiative
   heat loss obtained from thermal imaging of free-ranging monkeys in situ.
   Daily nutrient intakes were measured using continuous focal follows
   (average 6.9hr/day) of free-ranging individuals (27 days in spring and
   28 days in winter).
   4. We used a nutritional geometry framework to integrate these data and
   test three predictions: (a) In order to remain thermoneutral (balance
   heat loss with heat expenditure), golden snub-nosed monkeys increase
   daily energy consumption during the winter compared to spring; (b) this
   increase is achieved specifically by increasing intake of the primary
   energetic nutrients, carbohydrate and lipid, relative to protein; and
   (c) the seasonal increase in ingested fat and carbohydrate calories will
   quantitatively match the additional thermoregulatory costs in winter
   compared with spring.
   5. Our results showed that daily metabolisable energy intake in winter
   (721.5 kJ/mbm) was 1.8 times that in spring (399 kJ/mbm). As predicted,
   this difference was specific to fat and carbohydrate, whereas seasonal
   protein intake did not differ significantly. Winter consumption of fat
   and carbohydrate was 326 kJ/mbm per day greater than in spring, a value
   that closely matched the seasonal difference in the daily energetic
   costs of thermoregulation (329 kJ/mbm).
   6. This is the first study to test for a match between nutrient-specific
   homeostatic compensation and environmentally induced perturbations in
   nutrient requirements in free-ranging animals and underpins the
   potential for the homeostasis framework to provide predictive power to
   ecological models.}},

   revealed signals of host-associated divergence in both parasite species,
   while shallower phylogeographic structure varied between the two
   parasites. This suggests that although these parasites experienced
   similar landscapes and cyclic climate processes, temporally distinctive
   diversification events were associated with differences in the
   initiation of their association with host lineages. When climate cycles
   initiate diversification, partially congruent, but asynchronous,
   host-associated parasite phylogenies may emerge.}},

   Additionally, clownfishes are considered to be one of the rare groups to
   have experienced an adaptive radiation in the marine environment. Here,
   we assembled and annotated the first genome of a clownfish species, the
   tomato clownfish (Amphiprion frenatus). We obtained 17,801 assembled
   scaffolds, containing a total of 26,917 genes. The completeness of the
   assembly and annotation was satisfying, with 96.5\% of the
   Actinopterygii Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs)
   being retrieved in A.frenatus assembly. The quality of the resulting
   assembly is comparable to other bony fish assemblies. This resource is
   valuable for advancing studies of the particular life history traits of
   clownfishes, as well as being useful for population genetic studies and
   the development of new phylogenetic markers. It will also open the way
   to comparative genomics. Indeed, future genomic comparison among closely

  abstract                   = {{Mating often bears large costs to females, especially in species with
   high levels of sexual conflict over mating rates. Given the direct costs
   to females associated with multiple mating, which include reductions in
   lifespan and lifetime reproductive success, past research focused on
   identifying potential indirect benefits (through increases in offspring
   fitness) that females may accrue. Far less attention has, however, been
   devoted to understanding how costs of sexual interactions to females may
   extend across generations. Hence, little is known about the
   transgenerational implications of variation in mating rates, or the net
   consequences of maternal sexual activities across generations. Using the
   seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, a model system for the study of
   sexual conflict, we investigate the effects of mating with multiple
   males versus a single male, and tease apart effects due to sexual
   harassment and those due to mating per se, over three generations. A
   multigenerational analysis indicated that females that were exposed to
   ongoing sexual harassment and who also were permitted to mate with
   multiple males showed no difference in net fitness compared to females
   that mated just once without ongoing harassment. Intriguingly, however,
   females that were continually harassed, but permitted to mate just once,
   suffered a severe decline in net fitness compared to females that were
   singly (not harassed) or multiply mated (harassed, but potentially
   gaining benefits via mating with multiple males). Overall, the enhanced
   fitness in multiply mated compared to harassed females may indicate that
   multiple mating confers transgenerational benefits. These benefits may
   counteract, but do not exceed (i.e., we found no difference between
   singly and multiply mated females), the large transgenerational costs of
   harassment. Our study highlights the importance of examining
   transgenerational effects from an inclusive (looking at both indirect
   benefits but also costs) perspective, and the need to investigate
   transgenerational effects across several generations if we are to fully
   understand the consequences of sexual interactions, sexual conflict
   evolution, and the interplay of sexual conflict and multi-generational
   costs and benefits.}},

   importance of understanding microbiome-pathogen interactions. The
   amphibian cutaneous microbiome is widely studied for its potential to
   mitigate disease-mediated amphibian declines. Other microbial
   interactions in this system, however, have been largely neglected in the
   context of disease outbreaks. European fire salamanders have suffered
   dramatic population crashes as a result of the newly emerged
   Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). In this paper, we investigate
   microbial interactions on multiple fronts within this system. We show
   that wild, healthy fire salamanders maintain complex skin microbiotas
   containing Bsal-inhibitory members, but these community are present at a
   remarkably lowabundance. Through experimentation, we show that
   increasing bacterial densities of Bsal-inhibiting bacteria via daily
   addition slowed disease progression in fire salamanders. Additionally,
   we find that experimental-Bsal infection elicited subtle changes in the
   skin microbiome, with selected opportunistic bacteria increasing in
   relative abundance resulting in septicemic events that coincide with
   extensive destruction of the epidermis. These results suggest that fire
   salamander skin, in natural settings, maintains bacterial communities at
   numbers too low to confer sufficient protection against Bsal, and, in
   fact, the native skin microbiota can constitute a source of
   opportunistic bacterial pathogens that contribute to pathogenesis. By
   shedding light on the complex interaction between the microbiome and a
   lethal pathogen, these data put the interplay between skin microbiomes
   and a wildlife disease into a new perspective.}},

   shapes much of our social and cognitive lives. To a considerable extent,
   the distribution of this diversity is driven by environmental factors
   such as climate or coast access. An unresolved question is whether the
   relevant factors have remained constant over time. Here, we address this
   question at a global scale. We approximate the difference between
   pre-versus post-Neolithic populations by the difference between modern
   hunter-gatherer versus food-producing populations. Using a novel
   geostatistical approach of estimating language and language family
   densities, we show that environmental-chiefly climate factors-have
   driven the language density of food-producing populations considerably
   more strongly than the language density of hunter-gatherer populations.
   Current evidence suggests that the population dynamics of modern
   hunter-gatherers is very similar to that of what can be reconstructed
   from the Palaeolithic record. Based on this, we cautiously infer that
   the impact of environmental factors on language densities underwent a
   substantial change with the transition to agriculture. After this
   transition, the environmental impact on language diversity in
   food-producing populations has remained relatively stable since it can
   also be detected-albeit in slightly weaker form-in models that capture
   the reduced linguistic diversity during large-scale language spreads in
   the Mid-Holocene.}},

   cooperation, but the factors that tip the balance towards cooperation
   are incompletely understood. Previous observations of insect species
   suggest that (i) sibling cooperation is more likely when siblings hatch
   at the same time, and (ii) this is more common when parents provide
   little to no care. In this paper, we tested these ideas experimentally
   with the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides. Burying beetles
   convert the body of a small dead vertebrate into an edible nest for
   their larvae, and provision and guard their young after hatching. In our
   first experiment, we simulated synchronous or asynchronous hatching by
   adding larvae at different intervals to the carrion-breeding resource.
   We found that `synchronously' hatched broods survived better than
   `asynchronously' hatched broods, probably because `synchronous hatching'
   generated larger teams of larvae, that together worked more effectively
   to penetrate the carrion nest and feed upon it. In our second
   experiment, we measured the synchronicity of hatching in experimental
   populations that had evolved for 22 generations without any
   post-hatching care, and control populations that had evolved in parallel
   with post-hatching care. We found that larvae were more likely to hatch
   earlier, and at the same time as their broodmates, in the experimental
   populations that evolved without post-hatching care. We suggest that
   synchronous hatching enables offspring to help each other when parents
   are not present to provide care. However, we also suggest that greater
   levels of cooperation among siblings cannot compensate fully for the
   loss of parental care.}},

   threat of predation, and these have been generally well studied.
   However, one of the most common and taxonomically widespread
   antipredator behaviours of all has, remarkably, received almost no
   experimental attention: so-called `protean' behaviour. This is behaviour
   that is sufficiently unpredictable to prevent a predator anticipating in
   detail the future position or actions of its prey. In this study, we
   used human `predators' participating in 3D virtual reality simulations
   to test how protean (i.e. unpredictable) variation in prey movement
   affects participants' ability to visually target them as they move (a
   key determinant of successful predation). We found that targeting
   accuracy was significantly predicted by prey movement path complexity,
   although, surprisingly, there was little evidence that high levels of
   unpredictability in the underlying movement rules equated directly to
   decreased predator performance. Instead, the specific movement rules
   differed in how they impacted on targeting accuracy, with the efficacy
   of protean variation in one element depending on the values of the
   remaining elements. These findings provide important insights into the
   understudied phenomenon of protean antipredator behaviour, which are
   directly applicable to predator-prey dynamics within a broad range of
   taxa.}},

   (Latrodectus hesperus) is a medically relevant urban adapter pest

   urban and 11 non-urban locales with fine-scale within-city analyses
   including 30 urban locales across the western USA. These hierarchical
   datasets enable us to test hypotheses of how urbanization impacts
   multiple urban cities and their genetic connectivity at different
   spatial scales. Coupled fine-scale and broad-scale analyses reveal
   contrasting patterns of high and low genetic differentiation among
   locales within cities as a result of low and high genetic connectivity,
   respectively, of these cities to the overall population network. We
   discuss these results as they challenge the use of cities as replicates

   along gradients of temperature and precipitation. But it is not clear in
   most species whether this reflects very broad tolerance of climate
   conditions, or a high degree of genetic differentiation or phenotypic
   acclimation in their responses to local climate. Provenance trials and
   common garden experiments indicate that at least some tree species of
   the temperate forests of eastern North America show genetic
   differentiation in growth as a function of climate, although these
   studies have been largely limited to measurements on growth of seedlings
   and saplings. To test for evidence of either adaptation or acclimation
   in adult response to local climatic conditions, we used data from over
   23,000 tree cores collected by the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis
   program in the 1980s for 14 tree species distributed in states from
   Maine to Ohio. We tested a suite of alternate models for interannual
   variation in radial growth as a function of (1) tree age, (2) size, (3)
   temperature, and (4) precipitation. The models included climate
   variables from both the current and previous year. The alternate models
   allowed us to test whether growth was best predicted from absolute
   values of the climate variables, or from deviation of current or
   previous year climate from long-term average at the location of an
   individual tree core. In all 14 species, models that used deviation from
   local, long-term mean climate were superior, indicating that all 14
   species showed strong adaptation or acclimation to local climate. In
   most of the species, growth was highest in years that were cooler and
   wetter than long-term average at a location. The analysis does not allow
   us to distinguish between genetic differentiation and phenotypic
   acclimation responses. If the results are genetically based, trees
   within a given location could be much more sensitive to climate change
   than indicated by the very broad geographic distributions of these
   temperate tree species, but if the results are phenotypic, this would
   represent local acclimation that could help buffer species in the face
   of climate change.}},

   populations dominated by old postreproductive individuals, potentially
   resulting in a small and declining breeding population. Here, we conduct
   a single-sample evaluation of genetic erosion within contemporary
   populations of the Australian lungfish. Genetic erosion is a temporal
   decline in intraspecific diversity due to factors such as reduced
   population size and inbreeding. We examined whether young individuals
   showed signs of reduced genetic diversity and/or inbreeding using a
   novel bomb radiocarbon dating method to age lungfish nonlethally, based
   on C-14 ratios of scales. A total of 15,201 single nucleotide
   polymorphic (SNP) loci were genotyped in 92 individuals ranging in age
   from 2 to 77years old. Standardized individual heterozygosity and
   individual inbreeding coefficients varied widely within and between
   riverine populations, but neither was associated with age, so perceived
   problems with recruitment have not translated into genetic erosion that
   could be considered a proximate threat to lungfish populations.
   Conservation concern has surrounded Australian lungfish for over a
   century. However, our results suggest that long-lived threatened species
   can maintain stable levels of intraspecific variability when sufficient
   reproductive opportunities exist over the course of a long lifespan.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. A combination of timing of and body condition (i.e., mass) at arrival
   on the breeding grounds interact to influence the optimal combination of
   the timing of reproduction and clutch size in migratory species. This
   relationship has been formalized by Rowe et al. in a condition-dependent
   individual optimization model (American Naturalist, 1994, 143, 689-722),
   which has been empirically tested and validated in avian species with a
   capital-based breeding strategy.
   2. This model makes a key, but currently untested prediction; that
   variation in the rate of body condition gain will shift the optimal
   combination of laying date and clutch size. This prediction is essential
   because it implies that individuals can compensate for the challenges
   associated with late timing of arrival or poor body condition at arrival
   on the breeding grounds through adjustment of their life history
   investment decisions, in an attempt to maximize fitness.
   3. Using an 11-year data set in arctic-nesting common eiders (Somateria
   mollissima), quantification of fattening rates using plasma
   triglycerides (an energetic metabolite), and a path analysis approach,
   we test this prediction of this optimization model; controlling for
   arrival date and body condition, females that fatten more quickly will
   adjust the optimal combination of lay date and clutch size, in favour of
   a larger clutch size.
   4. As predicted, females fattening at higher rates initiated clutches
   earlier and produced larger clutch sizes, indicating that fattening rate
   is an important factor in addition to arrival date and body condition in
   predicting individual variation in reproductive investment. However,
   there was no direct effect of fattening rate on clutch size (i.e., birds
   laying on the same date had similar clutch sizes, independent of their
   fattening rate). Instead, fattening rate indirectly affected clutch size
   via earlier lay dates, thus not supporting the original predictions of
   the optimization model.
   5. Our results demonstrate that variation in the rate of condition gain
   allows individuals to shift flexibly along the seasonal decline in
   clutch size to presumably optimize the combination of laying date and
   clutch size.}},

   These findings demonstrate that male sensitivity to genetic perturbation

   Mauritia flexuosa presents significant genetic differentiation between

   pattern corroborated using the fossil pollen record, where the species
   was absent from the Cerrado during the cold and dry periods of the last

   Coalescent simulations show that the pattern of observed genetic
   diversity for M. flexuosa is most likely due to a range retraction
   during the Last Glacial Maximum, leading to multiple refugia and
   resulting in high differentiation between Amazonian and Cerrado biomes.
   Isolation-by-distance and by-environment also shaped the distribution

   Independent of variation in body size, males maintained under risk of
   sperm competition had a relatively thicker and more distally extended

   outstrips any other species. We also display extreme variation in
   decisions about whether to cooperate or not, and the mechanisms driving
   this variation remain an open question across the behavioural sciences.
   One candidate mechanism underlying this variation in cooperation is the
   evolutionary ancient neurohormone oxytocin (OT). As current research
   focuses on artificial administration of OT in asocial tasks, little is
   known about how the hormone in its naturally occurring state actually
   impacts behaviour in social interactions. Using a new optimal foraging
   paradigm, the `egg hunt', we assessed the association of endogenous OT
   with helping behaviour and conversation. We manipulated players' group
   membership relative to each other prior to an egg hunt, during which
   they had repeated opportunities to spontaneously help each other.
   Results show that endogenous baseline OT predicted helping and
   conversation type, but crucially as a function of group membership.
   Higher baseline OT predicted increased helping but only between in-group
   players, as well as decreased discussion about individuals' goals
   between in-group players but conversely more of such discussion between
   out-group players. Subsequently, behaviour but not conversation during
   the hunt predicted change in OT, in that out-group members who did not
   help showed a decrease in OT from baseline levels. In sum, endogenous OT
   predicts helping behaviour and conversation, importantly as a function
   of group membership, and this effect occurs in parallel to uniquely
   human cognitive processes.}},

   important ecosystem services such as sequestering carbon (blue carbon),
   maintaining healthy fisheries, and protecting shorelines. These salt
   marshes also constitute stunning red beach landscapes, and the resulting
   tourism significantly contributes to the local economy. However, land
   use change and degradation have led to a substantial loss of the red
   beach area. It remains unclear how human activities influence the
   top-down and bottom-up forces that regulate the distribution and
   succession of these salt marshes and lead to the degradation of the red
   beaches. We examined how bottom-up forces influenced the germination,
   emergence, and colonization of saline seepweed with field measurements
   and a laboratory experiment. We also examined whether top-down forces
   affected the red beach distribution by conducting a field survey for
   crab burrows and density, laboratory feeding trials, and waterbird
   investigations. The higher sediment accretion rate induced by human
   activities limited the establishment of new red beaches. The
   construction of tourism facilities and the frequent presence of tourists
   reduced the density of waterbirds, which in turn increased the density
   of crabs, intensifying the top-down forces such as predators and
   herbivores that drive the degradation of the coastal red beaches. Our
   results show that sediment accretion and plant-herbivory changes induced
   by human activities were likely the two primary ecological processes
   leading to the degradation of the red beaches. Human activities
   significantly shaped the abundance and distribution of the red beaches
   by altering both top-down and bottom-up ecological processes. Our
   findings can help us better understand the dynamics of salt marshes and
   have implications for the management and restoration of coastal

   streams, where many insects depend on litter as their primary food
   source? We test the hypothesis that slow decomposition rates promote
   element transfer from litter to insects, whereas rapid decomposition
   favors microbes. We measured carbon and nitrogen fluxes from four plant
   species to a leaf-shredding caddisfly using isotopically labeled litter.
   Caddisflies assimilated a higher percentage of litter carbon and
   nitrogen lost from slowly decomposing litters (Platanus wrightii and
   Quercus gambelii). In contrast, rapidly decomposing litters (Fraxinus
   velutina and Populus fremontii) supported higher microbial biomass.
   These results challenge the view that rapidly decomposing litter is
   higher quality by demonstrating that slowly decomposing litters provide
   a critical resource for insects.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. To secure mating opportunities, males often develop and maintain
   conspicuous traits that are involved in intrasexual and/or intersexual
   competition. While current models of sexual selection rely on the
   assumption that producing such traits is costly, quantifying the cost of
   allocating to secondary sexual traits remains challenging.
   2. According to the principle of allocation, high energy allocation to
   growth or sexual traits in males should lead to reduced energy
   allocation to the maintenance of cellular and physiological functions,
   potentially causing them to age faster, with impaired survival.
   3. We evaluated the short-term and delayed consequences of energy
   allocation to antlers early in life in two contrasted populations of roe
   deer, Capreolus capreolus. Although most males mate successfully for the
   first time in their fourth year, antlers are grown annually from the
   first year of life onwards. We tested the prediction that a high level
   of allocation to antler growth during the first two years of life should
   lead to lower body mass, antler size and survival during the early and
   late prime stages, as well as to reduced longevity overall.
   4. Growing and carrying long antlers during the first years of life was
   not associated with any detectable cost in the late prime stage. The
   positive association between antler growth in early life and adult body
   mass instead supports that fawn antler acts as an honest signal of
   phenotypic quality in roe deer.
   5. For a given body mass, yearling males growing longer antlers
   displayed impaired performance during their late prime. We also found a
   trend for a short-term survival cost of allocation to relative antler
   length during the second year of life.
   6.Yearling males that grow long antlers relative to their mass might
   display a fast life-history tactic. We argue that differential
   allocation to secondary sexual traits generates a diversity of
   individual trajectories that should impact population dynamics.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. While theoretical models predict reproductive allocation (RA) should
   approach 100\% of available energy as a plant ages, available empirical
   data suggest much lower RA values in perennial plants. In this study, we
   have two aims. First, we assess whether the discrepancy between theory
   and data arises from methodological differences in how growth and RA are
   calculated. Specifically, we hypothesize RA in older plants is large
   when compared to growth in leaf area, that is, after excluding turnover
   of stem and leaf tissues. Second, we hypothesize that species with cheap
   tissues or those that are shorter reach RA = 0.5 at a younger age.
   2. We measured investment in leaf, stem and reproduction on individuals
   from 14 co-occurring woody perennial iteroparous species. A fire
   chronosequence allowed us to use a space-for-time substitution to
   estimate RA schedules for each species, simultaneously measuring
   reproductive and vegetative production on individuals differing in age.
   3. For most (11 of 14) species, we found RA eventually reached 100\% of
   available energy, with another two species reaching at least 80\%.
   Increases in RA were associated with a decline in growth of leaf area.
   Comparing species, we found that species with cheap leaves reached RA =
   0.5 sooner (they could be called fast-living), whereas delayed
   maturation and slower increases in RA were associated with greater
   maximum height.
   4. Synthesis. Explicitly accounting for the cost of leaf replacement
   leads to the high estimates of reproductive allocation in perennial
   plants predicted by theoretical models, limiting or even halting leaf
   area expansion. For some species, so much energy is allocated to
   reproduction that leaf area declines year-upon-year for multiple growing
   seasons preceding death. Connecting lifetime reproductive allocation
   schedules with leaf area expansion, leaf life span, and plant maximum
   height demonstrates how reproductive allocation schedules synthesize a
   plant's life-history strategy, making them a valuable tool for
   connecting plant traits and demography.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Dead wood is a habitat for numerous fungal species, many of which are
   important agents of decomposition. Previous studies suggested that
   wood-inhabiting fungal communities are affected by climate, availability
   of dead wood in the surrounding landscape and characteristics of the
   colonized dead-wood object( e.g. host tree species). These findings
   indicate that different filters structure fungal communities at
   different scales, but how these factors individually drive fungal
   fruiting diversity on dead-wood objects is unknown.
   2. We conducted an orthogonal experiment comprising 180 plots( 0.1 ha)
   in a random block design and measured fungal fruit body richness and
   community composition on 720 dead-wood objects over the first 4 years of
   succession. The experiment allowed us to disentangle the effects of the
   host( beech and fir; logs and branches) and the environment(
   microclimate: sunny and shady plots; local dead wood: amount and
   heterogeneity of dead wood added to plot).
   3. Variance partitioning revealed that the host was more important than
   the environment for the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi. A more
   detailed model revealed that host tree species had the highest
   independent effect on richness and community composition of fruiting
   species of fungi. Host size had significant but low independent effects
   on richness and community composition of fruiting species. Canopy
   openness significantly affected the community composition of fruiting
   species. By contrast, neither local amount nor heterogeneity of dead
   wood significantly affected the fungal diversity measures.
   4. Synthesis. Our study identified host tree species as a more important
   driver of the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi than the environment,
   which suggests a hostcentred filter of this diversity in the early phase
   of the decomposition process. For the conservation of wood-inhabiting
   fungi, a high variety of host species in various microclimates is more
   important than the availability of dead wood at the stand level.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Northern forest ecosystems are projected to experience warmer growing
   seasons, as well as winters with reduced snowpack depth and duration.
   Reduced snowpack will expose soils to cold winter air and lead to
   increased frequency of freeze-thaw cycles. The interactions between
   warmer soils in the growing season and colder soils in winter may have
   important implications for the phenology, productivity and nutrient
   content of forest plants.
   2. We conducted an experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH,
   USA, to examine the effects of growing season warming, reduced depth and
   duration of winter snowpack, as well as increased frequency of soil
   freeze-thaw cycles on sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer
   rubrum) saplings. We examined the direct effects of soil temperatures on
   plant root health, timing of leaf-out, foliar nitrogen, rates of
   photosynthesis and growth, as well as the indirect effects of snowpack
   reduction on herbivory on plant stems.
   3. A smaller winter snowpack and increased frequency of soil freeze-thaw
   cycles in winter led to increased root damage and delayed leaf-out for
   maple saplings. Snowpack reduction decreased rates of stem herbivory in
   winter, indicating that alleviation of above-ground stem damage in
   winters with reduced snowpack may offset the root damage incurred from
   successive soil freeze-thaw cycles in winters with low snowpack.
   4. Synthesis. By examining the response of two dominant tree species to
   simulated climate change in both the growing season and winter, we find
   that plant responses are mediated through a combination of changes in
   soil temperature and plant-herbivore interactions that differentially
   affect above- and below-ground plant components. These results highlight
   the feedbacks between trophic levels that shape forest function and
   demonstrate the need for considering climate change across seasons in
   global change experiments to determine how forest function may change in
   the future.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Biotic resistance represents an important natural barrier to
   potential invaders throughout the world, yet the underlying mechanisms
   that drive such resistance are still debated. In theory, native
   communities should repel both functionally similar invaders which
   compete for the same resources, and invaders which possess less
   competitive traits. However, environmental stress, trade-offs across
   vital rates and competition-induced plastic trait shifts may modify
   expected competitive outcomes, thereby influencing invasion dynamics.
   2. In order to test these theoretical links between trait distributions
   and biotic resistance, we performed a mesocosm experiment with 25
   non-native ornamental species invading native plant communities. Each
   non-native species was grown with and without the native community under
   two watering treatments (regular and reduced). We measured biotic
   resistance as the difference in performance of non-native individuals
   grown with and without the community in terms of their survival, growth
   and reproduction. We quantified overall functional dissimilarity between
   non-native ornamental individuals and native communities based on the
   combination of plant height, specific leaf area and seed mass. Then,
   assuming each of these traits is also potentially linked to competitive
   ability, we measured the position of non-natives on trait hierarchies.
   While height is positively correlated with competitive ability for light
   interception, conservative leaf and seed characteristics provide greater
   tolerance to competition for other resources. Finally, we quantified
   plastic trait shifts of non-native individuals induced by competition.
   3. Indeed, the native community repelled functionally similar
   individuals by lowering the invader's survival rate. Simultaneously,
   shorter ornamental individuals with larger specific leaf areas were less
   tolerant to biotic resistance from the community across vital rates,
   although the effect of trait hierarchies often depended on watering
   conditions. Finally, non-natives responded to competition by shifting
   their traits. Most importantly, individuals with more competitive traits
   were able to overcome biotic resistance also through competition-induced
   plastic trait shifts.
   4. Synthesis. Our results highlight that both functional dissimilarity
   and trait hierarchies mediate biotic resistance to ornamental plant
   invaders. Nevertheless, environmental stress as well as opposing trends
   across vital rates are also influential. Furthermore, plastic trait
   shifts can reinforce potential invaders' competitive superiority,
   determining a positive feedback.}},

   Although additive genetic variation and novel combinations of parental
   genes theoretically increase the potential for hybrid species to adapt,
   few empirical studies have investigated the adaptive potential within a
   hybrid species. Here, we address whether genomic contingencies,
   adaptation to climate, or diet best explain divergence in beak
   morphology using genomically diverged island populations of the
   homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae from Crete, Corsica, and
   Sicily. Populations vary significantly in beak morphology both between
   and within islands of origin. Temperature seasonality best explains
   population divergence in beak size. Interestingly, beak shape along all
   significant dimensions of variation was best explained by annual
   precipitation, genomic composition, and their interaction, suggesting a
   role for contingencies. Moreover, beak shape similarity to a parent
   species correlates with proportion of the genome inherited from that
   species, consistent with the presence of contingencies. In conclusion,
   adaptation to local conditions and genomic contingencies arising from
   putatively independent hybridization events jointly explain beak
   morphology in the Italian sparrow. Hence, hybridization may induce
   contingencies and restrict evolution in certain directions dependent on
   the genetic background.}},

   ecosystems, with major implications for ecological interactions in
   plankton communities. Yet it remains unclear how evolution may affect
   the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions. Here,
   we address this issue by analyzing an eco-evolutionary model of
   phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions with explicit nitrogen and
   phosphorus dynamics. In our model, investment of phytoplankton in
   nitrogen versus phosphorus uptake is an evolving trait, and zooplankton
   display selectivity for phytoplankton with N:P ratios matching their
   nutritional requirements. We use this model to explore implications of
   the contrasting N:P requirements of copepods versus cladocerans. The
   model predicts that selective zooplankton strongly affect the N:P ratio
   of phytoplankton, resulting in deviations from their optimum N:P ratio.
   Specifically, selective grazing by nitrogen-demanding copepods favors
   dominance of phytoplankton with low N:P ratios, whereas
   phosphorus-demanding cladocerans favor dominance of phytoplankton with
   high N:P ratios. Interestingly, selective grazing by nutritionally
   balanced zooplankton leads to the occurrence of alternative stable
   states, where phytoplankton may evolve either low, optimum, or high N:P
   ratios, depending on the initial conditions. These results offer a new
   perspective on commonly observed differences in N:P stoichiometry
   between plankton of freshwater and those of marine ecosystems and
   indicate that selective grazing by zooplankton can have a major impact
   on the stoichiometric composition of phytoplankton.}},

   long-term monitoring programmes. Commonly used methods to assess mammal
   biodiversity may require substantial sampling effort to be effective.
   Genetic methods are a new and important sampling tool on the horizon,
   but obtaining sufficient DNA samples can be a challenge.
   2. We evaluated the efficacy of using parasitic leeches Haemadipsa spp.,
   as compared to camera trapping, to sample biodiversity. We collected 200
   leeches from four forest patches in northeast Bangladesh, and identified
   recent vertebrate hosts using Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene
   extracted from each individual leech's blood meals. We then compared
   these data to species data from camera trapping conducted in the same
   forest patches.
   3. Overall, 41.9\% of sequenced leeches contained amplifiable non-human
   mammal DNA. Four days of collecting leeches led to the identification of
   12 species, compared to 26 species identified in 1,334 camera trap
   nights.
   4. Synthesis and applications. After assessing the cost, effort and
   power of each technique, there are pros and cons to both camera trapping
   and leech blood meal analysis. Camera trapping and leech collection
   appear to be complementary approaches. When used together, they may
   provide a more complete monitoring tool for mammal biodiversity in
   tropical rainforests. Managers should consider adding leech collection
   to their biodiversity monitoring toolkit, as improved information will
   allow managers to create more effective conservation programmes.}},

   decisions about how many offspring to produce are often based upon the
   prevailing environmental conditions, such as resource availability, and
   getting these decisions wrong may have important fitness consequences
   for both parents and offspring. We tested for effects of inbreeding on
   individual decision-making in the burying beetle Nicrophorus
   vespilloides, which uses the size of a carrion resource to make
   decisions about number of offspring. Both inbred and outbred females
   adjusted their initial decisions about number of eggs to lay based on
   carcass size. However, when we forced individuals to update this initial
   decision by providing them with a different-sized carcass partway
   through reproduction, inbred females failed to update their decision
   about how many larvae to cull. Consequently, inbred females reared too
   many larvae, resulting in negative fitness consequences in the form of
   smaller offspring and reduced female post-reproductive condition. Our

   sites annually. Their migrations include storied feats of endurance and
   physiology, from non-stop trans-Pacific crossings to flights at the
   cruising altitudes of jetliners. Despite intense interest in these
   performances, there remains great uncertainty about which factors most
   directly influence bird behaviour during migratory flights. We used GPS
   trackers that measure an individual's altitude and wingbeat frequency to
   track the migration of black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa) and identify
   the abiotic factors influencing their in-flight migratory behaviour. We
   found that godwits flew at altitudes above 5000 m during 21\% of all
   migratory flights, and reached maximum flight altitudes of nearly 6000
   m. The partial pressure of oxygen at these altitudes is less than 50\%
   of that at sea level, yet these extremely high flights occurred in the
   absence of topographical barriers. Instead, they were associated with
   high air temperatures at lower altitudes and increasing wind support at
   higher altitudes. Our results therefore suggest that wind, temperature
   and topography all play a role in determining migratory behaviour, but
   that their relative importance is context dependent. Extremely
   high-altitude flights may thus not be especially rare, but they may only
   occur in very specific environmental contexts.}},

  abstract                   = {{The well-developed Achilles tendon in humans is generally interpreted as
   an adaptation for mechanical energy storage and reuse during cyclic
   locomotion. All other extant great apes have a short tendon and
   long-fibred triceps surae, which is thought to be beneficial for
   locomotion in a complex arboreal habitat as this morphology enables a
   large range of motion. Surprisingly, highly arboreal gibbons show a more
   human-like triceps surae with a long Achilles tendon. Evidence for a
   spring-like function similar to humans is not conclusive. We revisit and
   integrate our anatomical and biomechanical data to calculate the energy
   that can be recovered from the recoiling Achilles tendon during ankle
   plantar flexion in bipedal gibbons. Only 7.5\% of the required external
   positive work in a stride can come from tendon recoil, yet it is
   delivered at an instant when the whole-body energy level drops.
   Consequently, an additional similar amount of mechanical energy must
   simultaneously dissipate elsewhere in the system. Altogether, this
   challenges the concept of an energy-saving function in the gibbon's
   Achilles tendon. Cercopithecids, sister group of the apes, also have a
   human-like triceps surae. Therefore, a well-developed Achilles tendon,
   present in the last common `Cercopithecoidea-Hominoidea' ancestor, seems
   plausible. If so, the gibbon's anatomy represents an evolutionary relict
   (no harm-no benefit), and the large Achilles tendon is not the premised
   key adaptation in humans (although the spring-like function may have
   further improved during evolution). Moreover, the triceps surae anatomy
   of extant non-human great apes must be a convergence, related to muscle
   control and range of motion. This perspective accords with the
   suggestions put forward in the literature that the last common hominoid
   ancestor was not necessarily great ape-like, but might have been more
   similar to the small-bodied catarrhines.}},

   hierarchy as measured in a tube test. Male fragile-X `knockout' rats

   Hemisphere, bears occur at exceptionally high densities. Salmon, by
   growing bear populations, have the potential to exert wide-ranging
   effects on ecosystem processes. Salmon-supported bears provide seed
   dispersal services to plants, and bear scats containing thousands of
   seeds may then be efficient nutritional resources for granivorous small
   mammals that also function as secondary seed dispersers while hoarding
   seeds for winter. We taxonomically identified and enumerated seeds in
   individual bear scats to characterize patterns of bear frugivory. We
   then combined estimates of seed abundance and digestible energy content
   to quantify the energy available to granivorous small mammals, and we
   quantified the proportion of the mouse population that could be
   supported by locally abundant bear populations in lowland salmon
   systems. We additionally monitored seed-filled bear scats with remote
   cameras to quantify small mammal visitation rates, and live-trapped
   small mammals seasonally to determine whether rodents visited bear scats
   proportional to their densities or whether some species preferentially
   selected for bear scats, and to assess whether seasonal variation in
   scat visitation was driven by density or selection. Bears were an
   important initial dispersal agent for 12 species of fruit, particularly
   devil's club (Oplopanax horridus) and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), which
   occurred in 80\% (5839 seeds/scat) and 50\% (10,719 seeds/scat) of
   scats, respectively. Seeds in bear scats were intensively utilized and
   dispersed by small mammals, primarily scatter-hoarding northwestern deer
   mice (Peromyscus keeni; 8.5 visits per day/4295 total visits) and
   larder-hoarding northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus; 2.2 visits
   per day/1099 total visits), with visitation rates proportional to the
   seasonal density of each species. Small mammals likely incurred
   significant nutritional benefits from seeds deposited in bear scats
   (kcal/scat, mean = 114, n = 71). In coastal Alaska riparian areas, bears
   are potentially capable of indirectly subsidizing the energy needs of
   45-65\% of local deer mouse populations. Thus, this work helps elucidate
   the role that salmon, by supporting abundant bears, plays in ecological
   communities via influencing seed dispersal and resource subsidies to the
   small mammals that compose the base of the food web.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Offspring size is a key functional trait that can affect all phases
   of the life history, from birth to reproduction, and is common to all
   the Metazoa. Despite its ubiquity, reviews of this trait tend to be
   taxon-specific. We explored the causes and consequences of offspring
   size variation across plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.
   2. We find that offspring size shows clear latitudinal patterns among
   species: fish, amphibians, invertebrates and birds show a positive
   covariation in offspring size with latitude; plants and turtles show a
   negative covariation with latitude. We highlight the developmental
   window hypothesis as an explanation for why plants and turtles show
   negative covariance with latitude. Meanwhile, we find evidence for
   stronger, positive selection on offspring size at higher latitudes for
   most animals.
   3. Offspring size also varies at all scales of organization, from
   populations through to broods from the same female. We explore the
   reasons for this variation and suspect that much of this variation is
   adaptive, but in many cases, there are too few tests to generalize.
   4. We show that larger offspring lose relatively less energy during
   development to independence such that larger offspring may have greater
   net energy budgets than smaller offspring. Larger offspring therefore
   enter the independent phase with relatively more energy reserves than
   smaller offspring. This may explain why larger offspring tend to
   outperform smaller offspring but more work on how offspring size affects
   energy acquisition is needed.
   5. While life-history theorists have been fascinated by offspring size
   for over a century, key knowledge gaps remain. One important next step
   is to estimate the true energy costs of producing offspring of different
   sizes and numbers.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Mixed mating and variation in outcrossing rate among populations of
   the same species are common. Outcrossing can be affected by pollinator
   activity and floral traits that facilitate or impede autonomous
   self-fertilization. However, the relative contribution of pollen
   limitation and evolved differences in the ability to self-fertilize to
   variation in the mating system is poorly understood and can only be
   disentangled using an experimental approach.
   2. We placed arrays of plants from eight Campanula americana populations
   that varied in autonomous selfing ability (hereafter ``autonomy{''}) in
   sun and shade habitats to create high- and low-pollination environments.
   Floral visitors were observed and pollen limitation, dichogamy,
   herkogamy and pollen persistence within the flower were measured.
   Outcrossing rate was estimated for a subset of the arrays.
   3. Pollen limitation was over three times higher in the shade than the
   sun due to differences in pollinator visitation. Populations with high
   levels of autonomy displayed greater pollen persistence and dichogamy in
   the more pollen-limited environments than in the high-pollination
   environments. In these high-autonomy populations, outcrossing rates were
   tightly associated with pollen limitation, with reduced outcrossing
   under strong pollen limitation. In contrast, populations with
   intermediate autonomy levels had less plastic floral traits and their
   outcrossing rates changed little with pollen limitation.
   4. Mating system was shaped by both the pollination environment and the
   magnitude of plasticity in floral traits. The experimental approach used
   here revealed that plasticity in floral traits provides the ability to
   adjust mating system in response to limited potential for outcrossing.
   The lack of plasticity in some populations could explain mismatches
   between pollinator activity and mating system in natural populations.
   Finally, flexibility in the mating system may help explain the
   prevalence of mixed mating.}},

  abstract                   = {{In an attempt to clarify the role of environmental and biotic
   interactions on plant growth, there has been a long-running ecological
   debate over whether the intensity and importance of competition
   stabilizes, increases or decreases across environmental gradients. We
   conducted an experiment in a Chinese estuary to investigate the effects
   of a non-resource stress gradient, soil salinity (from 1.4 parts per
   thousand to 19.0 parts per thousand salinity), on the competitive
   interactions between native Phragmites australis and invasive Spartina
   alterniflora. We linked these effects to measurements of photosynthetic
   activities to further elucidate the underlying physiological mechanism
   behind the competitive interactions and the driver of invasion. The
   experiments revealed that while biomass of both species decreased in the
   presence of the other, competition did not alter photosynthetic activity
   of either species over time. P.australis exhibited high photosynthetic
   activity, including low chlorophyllase activity, high chlorophyll
   content, high stomatal conductance and high net photosynthetic rate, at
   low salinity. Under these conditions, P.australis experienced low
   competitive intensity, leading to high biomass production and
   competitive exclusion of S.alterniflora. The opposite was observed for
   S.alterniflora: while competitive intensity experienced by P.australis
   increased with increasing salinity, and photosynthetic activity,
   biomass, competitive dominance and the importance of competition for
   P.australis growth decreased, those of S.alterniflora were stable. These
   findings demonstrate that S.alterniflora invasion driven by competitive
   exclusion are likely to occur and expand in high salinity zones. The
   change in the nature of competition along a non-resource stress gradient
   differs between competitors likely due to differences in photosynthetic
   tolerance to salinity. The driver of growth of the less-tolerant species
   changes from competition to non-resource stress factors with increasing
   stress levels, whereas competition is constantly important for growth of
   the more-tolerant species. Incorporating metrics of both competition
   intensity and importance, as well as linking these competitive outcomes
   with physiological mechanisms, is crucial to understanding, predicting,
   and mediating the effects of invasive species in the future.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. In occupancy studies, species misidentification can lead to
   false-positive detections, which can cause severe estimator biases.
   Currently, all models that account for false-positive errors only
   consider omnibus sources of false detections and are limited to
   single-species occupancy.
   2. However, false detections for a given species often occur because of
   the misidentification with another, closely related species. To exploit
   this explicit source of false-positive detection error, we develop a
   two-species occupancy model that accounts for misidentifications between
   two species of interest. As with other false-positive models,
   identifiability is greatly improved by the availability of unambiguous
   detections at a subset of site x occasions. Here, we consider the case
   where some of the field observations can be confirmed using laboratory
   or other independent identification methods ({''}confirmatory data{''}).
   3. We performed three simulation studies to (1) assess the model's
   performance under various realistic scenarios, (2) investigate the
   influence of the proportion of confirmatory data on estimator accuracy
   and (3) compare the performance of this two-species model with that of
   the single-species false-positive model. The model shows good
   performance under all scenarios, even when only small proportions of
   detections are confirmed (e.g. 5\%). It also clearly outperforms the
   single-species model.
   4. We illustrate application of this model using a 4-year dataset on two
   sympatric species of lungless salamanders: the US federally endangered
   Shenandoah salamander Plethodon shenandoah, and its presumed competitor,
   the red-backed salamander Plethodon cinereus. Occupancy of red-backed
   salamanders appeared very stable across the 4 years of study, whereas
   the Shenandoah salamander displayed substantial turnover in occupancy of
   forest habitats among years.
   5. Given the extent of species misidentification issues in occupancy
   studies, this modelling approach should help improve the reliability of
   estimates of species distribution, which is the goal of many studies and
   monitoring programmes. Further developments, to account for different
   forms of state uncertainty, can be readily undertaken under our general
   approach.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. There are now many examples where ecological researchers used
   non-Euclidean distance metrics in geostatistical models that were
   designed for Euclidean distance, such as those used for kriging. This
   can lead to problems where predictions have negative variance estimates.
   Technically, this occurs because the spatial covariance matrix, which
   depends on the geostatistical models, is not guaranteed to be positive
   definite when non-Euclidean distance metrics are used. These are not
   permissible models, and should be avoided.
   2. I give a quick review of kriging and illustrate the problem with
   several simulated examples, including locations on a circle, locations
   on a linear dichotomous network (such as might be used for streams), and
   locations on a linear trail or road network. I re-examine the linear
   network distance models from Ladle, Avgar, Wheatley, and Boyce (,
   Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 8, 329) and show that they are not
   guaranteed to have a positive definite covariance matrix.
   3. I introduce the reduced-rank method, also called a predictive-process
   model, for creating valid spatial covariance matrices with non-Euclidean
   distance metrics. It has an additional advantage of fast computation for
   large datasets.
   4. I re-analysed the data of Ladle etal. (, Methods in Ecology and
   Evolution, 8, 329), showing that fitted models that used linear network
   distance in geostatistical models, both with and without a nugget
   effect, had negative variances, poor predictive performance compared
   with reduced-rank methods, and had improper coverage for the prediction
   intervals. The reduced-rank approach using linear network distances
   provided a class of permissible models that had better predictive
   performance and proper coverage for the prediction intervals, and could
   be combined with Euclidean distance models to provide the best overall
   predictive performance.}},

  abstract                   = {{Understanding the role of larger-scale processes in modulating the
   assembly, structure, and dynamics of communities is critical for
   forecasting the effects of climate-change and managing ecosystems.
   Developing this comprehensive perspective is difficult though, because
   species interactions are complex, interdependent, and dynamic through
   space and time. Typically, experiments focus on tractable subsets of
   interactions that will be most critical to investigate and explain
   shifts in communities, but qualitatively base these choices on
   experience, natural history, and theory. One quantitative approach to
   identify the putative forces regulating communities, without reducing
   system complexity, is estimating transition probabilities among species
   occupying space (i.e., multispecies Markov chain models). Although not
   mechanistic, these models estimate the relative frequency and importance
   of ecological pathways in community assembly and dynamics, and can serve
   as a framework to identify how pathways change across large scales and
   which are most important to investigate further. Here, we demonstrate
   this method in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) intertidal zone, where research
   has largely focused on the local-scale processes that influence
   communities, while the mechanisms responsible for more regional shifts
   in communities are less clear. Transition probabilities of faunal
   elements were quantified bimonthly for similar to 2.5yr in local
   intertidal communities at three replicate sites in the southern,
   mid-coast, and northern GOM. Transitions related to mortality,
   colonization, and replacement by mussels, barnacles, red algae, and
   encrusting corallines differed regionally, suggesting specific pathways
   related to consumer pressure and recruitment vary across the GOM with
   shifting intertidal community structure. Combined with species abundance
   data and insights from previous research, we develop and evaluate the
   pathways by which communities likely change in the GOM. Species
   interactions in local communities can be complex, and this complexity
   should be incorporated into hypothesis building, experiments, theory,
   interpretations, and forecasts in ecology. Such a comprehensive approach
   will be critical to understand how regional shifts in local interactions
   can drive large-scale community change.}},

   In addition, the sexes differ in their sensitivity to environmental

   coloration varies in relation to sex and sunlight exposure in developing
   griffon vultures Gyps fulvus and how this correlates with survival. The
   results show that individuals grown in nests more exposed to sunlight
   developed paler plumages, as predicted by the thermal melanism
   hypothesis. In addition, paler malesbut not femaleshave lower survival
   probability. Finally, a significant sexual dichromatism in fledgling
   plumage was observed, with females being paler than males. These results
   reveal within-population color variation related to sunlight temperature

   a known source of bias in many comparative analyses, yet classic
   adaptive radiations have not been studied comparatively with

   comprehensive phylogenetic sampling of Anolis lizard species to examine
   comparative evolution in this well-studied adaptive radiation. We
   compare adaptive radiation models within Anolis and in the Anolis clade

   innovation) effects causing accelerated body size evolution within
   Anolis. However, island effects are scale dependent: when Anolis and
   Corytophanidae are analyzed together, no island effect is evident. We
   find no evidence for an island effect on speciation rate and tenuous

  abstract                   = {{Cooperative behaviours in archaic hunter-gatherers could have been
   maintained partly due to the gains from cooperation being shared with
   kin. However, the question arises as to how cooperation was maintained
   after early humans transitioned to larger groups of unrelated
   individuals. We hypothesize that after cooperation had evolved via
   benefits to kin, the consecutive evolution of cognition increased the
   returns from cooperating, to the point where benefits to self were
   sufficient for cooperation to remain stable when group size increased
   and relatedness decreased. We investigate the theoretical plausibility
   of this hypothesis, with both analytical modelling and simulations. We
   examine situations where cognition either (i) increases the benefits of
   cooperation, (ii) leads to synergistic benefits between cognitively
   enhanced cooperators, (iii) allows the exploitation of less intelligent
   partners, and (iv) the combination of these effects. We find that
   cooperation and cognition can coevolve-cooperation initially evolves,
   favouring enhanced cognition, which favours enhanced cooperation, and
   stabilizes cooperation against a drop in relatedness. These results
   suggest that enhanced cognition could have transformed the nature of
   cooperative dilemmas faced by early humans, thereby explaining the
   maintenance of cooperation between unrelated partners.}},

   To the best of our knowledge, this is the most derived unitary metazoan

   Fusion occurred among hatched blastulae, never during earlier
   (unhatched) or later (larval) stages. The fully fused chimaeric
   propagules were two to five times larger than non-chimaeric embryos.
   Fusion was positively correlated with propagule density and facilitated
   by the natural tendency of early embryos to agglomerate. The discovery
   of natural chimaerism in a unitary deuterostome that possesses large
   externally fertilized eggs provides a framework to explore key aspects

   possibly carcinogenic, mainly based on rather consistent epidemiological
   findings suggesting a link between childhood leukaemia and 50-60 Hz
   magnetic fields from power lines. However, causality is not the only
   possible explanation for the epidemiological associations, as animal and
   in vitro experiments have provided only limited support for carcinogenic
   effects of ELF magnetic fields. Importantly, there is no generally
   accepted biophysical mechanism that could explain such effects. In this
   review, we discuss the possibility that carcinogenic effects are based
   on the radical pair mechanism (RPM), which seems to be involved in
   magnetoreception in birds and certain other animals, allowing navigation
   in the geomagnetic field. We review the current understanding of the RPM
   in magnetoreception, and discuss cryptochromes as the putative
   magnetosensitive molecules and their possible links to cancer-relevant
   biological processes. We then propose a hypothesis for explaining the
   link between ELF fields and childhood leukaemia, discuss the strengths
   and weaknesses of the current evidence, and make proposals for further

  abstract                   = {{Marine populations are typically characterized by weak genetic
   differentiation due to the potential for long-distance dispersal
   favouring high levels of gene flow. However, strong directional
   advection of water masses or retentive hydrodynamic forces can influence
   the degree of genetic exchange among marine populations. To determine
   the oceanographic drivers of genetic structure in a highly dispersive
   marine invertebrate, the giant California sea cucumber (Parastichopus
   californicus), we first tested for the presence of genetic
   discontinuities along the coast of North America in the northeastern
   Pacific Ocean. Then, we tested two hypotheses regarding spatial
   processes influencing population structure: (i) isolation by distance
   (IBD: genetic structure is explained by geographic distance) and (ii)
   isolation by resistance (IBR: genetic structure is driven by ocean
   circulation). Using RADseq, we genotyped 717 individuals from 24
   sampling locations across 2,719 neutral SNPs to assess the degree of
   population differentiation and integrated estimates of genetic variation
   with inferred connectivity probabilities from a biophysical model of
   larval dispersal mediated by ocean currents. We identified two clusters
   separating north and south regions, as well as significant, albeit weak,
   substructure within regions (F-ST = 0.002, p = .001). After modelling
   the asymmetric nature of ocean currents, we demonstrated that local
   oceanography (IBR) was a better predictor of genetic variation (R-2 =
   .49) than geographic distance (IBD) (R-2 = .18), and directional
   processes played an important role in shaping fine-scale structure. Our
   study contributes to the growing body of literature identifying
   significant population structure in marine systems and has important
   implications for the spatial management of P.californicus and other

   that enhance their individual performance. However, there have been few
   attempts to empirically test the relationship between an animals'
   habitat use and performance. This is surprising, since knowing about
   this connection should enhance our ability to predict the local
   population dynamics of ecologically important species. Here, we used
   three primary experiments to assess the relationship between habitat use
   and performance for an important insect consumer (ladybeetles). First,
   we used field manipulations of resource availability (i.e., scale
   insects and cordgrass pollen) to examine the habitat use of ladybeetle
   predators. Second, we conducted a series of no-choice laboratory assays
   to compare the performance (fecundity and longevity) of ladybeetles on
   these different resources. Third, we quantified adult ladybeetle
   preference for olfactory cues from cordgrass with and without scale
   insects using a Y-tube olfactometer. In the field, adult ladybeetles
   selectively used plots containing scale insects. In the laboratory,
   diets containing scale insects maximized both adult and larval
   ladybeetle longevity, and adult fecundity. Adult ladybeetles were
   attracted to chemical cues associated with scale insects over distances
   of 10s of centimeters. Overall, our findings suggest that the habitat
   use and performance of ladybeetles are strongly linked, with ladybeetles
   preferentially using habitats that maximize their individual
   performance.}},

   commonly assume linearity on the log-scale, leading to log-normally
   distributed rates of increase. While this is often computationally
   convenient, in particular when performing statistical inference in the
   presence of observation error, it may lead to unrealistic predictions
   for animals with a limited reproduction. We introduce a model that
   includes an explicit bound on the reproductive rate of an individual,
   and apply this to a population time series of ungulates in Kruger
   National Park, South Africa. Due to observational error, the
   year-to-year increases in animal counts occasionally exceeded the
   maximal reproductive rate of the animals. In such cases, the traditional
   unbounded model showed a tendency of overfitting data, leading to
   unrealistic predictions of the underlying population increase. An
   observed increase above the maximal reproductive rate also provides
   empirical confirmation that observation error exists. The model with an
   explicit bound was able to utilize this in order to separate
   observational error from population process noise, which the traditional
   unbounded model was unable to do. We conclude that enforcing a strict
   upper bound on the reproductive rate of an animal population model may
   lead to more realistic statistical inference than commonly applied
   log-linear models when an explicit bound on reproductive rate is known.
   We further conclude that introducing a bound on reproduction can greatly
   assist in separating observational error and population process noise
   for slow life histories, or more generally, when the rate of sampling is
   high compared to reproductive rates.}},

  abstract                   = {{Understanding how annual climate variation affects population growth
   rates across a species' range may help us anticipate the effects of
   climate change on species distribution and abundance. We predict that
   populations in warmer or wetter parts of a species' range should respond
   negatively to periods of above average temperature or precipitation,
   respectively, whereas populations in colder or drier areas should
   respond positively to periods of above average temperature or
   precipitation. To test this, we estimated the population sensitivity of
   a common shrub species, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), to annual
   climate variation across its range. Our analysis includes 8,175
   observations of year-to-year change in sagebrush cover or production
   from 131 monitoring sites in western North America. We coupled these
   observations with seasonal weather data for each site and analyzed the
   effects of spring through fall temperatures and fall through spring
   accumulated precipitation on annual changes in sagebrush abundance.
   Sensitivity to annual temperature variation supported our hypothesis:
   years with above average temperatures were beneficial to sagebrush in
   colder locations and detrimental to sagebrush in hotter locations. In
   contrast, sensitivity to precipitation did not change significantly
   across the distribution of sagebrush. This pattern of responses suggests
   that regional abundance of this species may be more limited by
   temperature than by precipitation. We also found important differences
   in how the ecologically distinct subspecies of sagebrush responded to
   the effects of precipitation and temperature. Our model predicts that a
   short-term temperature increase could produce an increase in sagebrush
   cover at the cold edge of its range and a decrease in cover at the warm
   edge of its range. This prediction is qualitatively consistent with
   predictions from species distribution models for sagebrush based on
   spatial occurrence data, but it provides new mechanistic insight and
   helps estimate how much and how fast sagebrush cover may change within
   its range.}},

   influence evolutionary responses to selection remains ambiguous. We
   tested the degree to which MEs can alter the rate of adaptation of a key
   life-history trait, clutch size, using an individual-based model
   approach parameterized with experimental data from a long-term study of
   great tits (Parus major). We modeled two types of MEs: (i) an
   environmentally plastic ME, in which the relationship between maternal
   and offspring clutch size depended on the maternal environment via
   offspring condition, and (ii) a fixed ME, in which this relationship was
   constant. Although both types of ME affected the rate of adaptation
   following an abrupt environmental shift, the overall effects were small.
   We conclude that evolutionary consequences of MEs are modest at best in
   our study system, at least for the trait and the particular type of ME
   we considered here. A closer link between theoretical and empirical work
   on MEs would hence be useful to obtain accurate predictions about the
   evolutionary consequences of MEs more generally.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Quantifying the relationship between tree diameter and height is a
   key component of efforts to estimate biomass and carbon stocks in
   tropical forests. Although substantial site-to-site variation in
   height-diameter allometries has been documented, the time consuming
   nature of measuring all tree heights in an inventory plot means that
   most studies do not include height, or else use generic pan-tropical or
   regional allometric equations to estimate height.
   2. Using a pan-tropical dataset of 73 plots where at least 150 trees had
   in-field ground-based height measurements, we examined how the number of
   trees sampled affects the performance of locally derived height-diameter
   allometries, and evaluated the performance of different methods for
   sampling trees for height measurement.
   3. Using cross-validation, we found that allometries constructed with
   just 20 locally measured values could often predict tree height with
   lower error than regional or climate-based allometries (mean reduction
   in prediction error = 0.46 m). The predictive performance of locally
   derived allometries improved with sample size, but with diminishing
   returns in performance gains when more than 40 trees were sampled.
   Estimates of stand-level biomass produced using local allometries to
   estimate tree height show no over- or under-estimation bias when
   compared with biomass estimates using field measured heights. We
   evaluated five strategies to sample trees for height measurement, and
   found that sampling strategies that included measuring the heights of
   the ten largest diameter trees in a plot outperformed (in terms
   of-resulting in local height-diameter models with low height prediction
   error) entirely random or diameter size-class stratified approaches.
   4. Our results indicate that even limited sampling of heights can be
   used to refine height-diameter allometries. We recommend aiming for a
   conservative threshold of sampling 50 trees per location for height
   measurement, and including the ten trees with the largest diameter in
   this sample.}},

  abstract                   = {{Inbreeding depression, the reduced fitness of offspring of closely
   related parents, is commonplace in both captive and wild populations and
   has important consequences for conservation and mating system evolution.
   However, because of the difficulty of collecting pedigree and
   life-history data from wild populations, relatively few studies have
   been able to compare inbreeding depression for traits at different
   points in the life cycle. Moreover, pedigrees give the expected
   proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBDg) whereas in
   theory with enough molecular markers realized IBDg can be quantified
   directly. We therefore investigated inbreeding depression for multiple
   life-history traits in a wild population of banded mongooses using
   pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients (f(ped)) and standardized
   multilocus heterozygosity (sMLH) measured at 35-43 microsatellites.
   Within an information theoretic framework, we evaluated support for
   either f(ped) or sMLH as inbreeding terms and used sequential regression
   to determine whether the residuals of sMLH on f(ped) explain fitness
   variation above and beyond f(ped). We found no evidence of inbreeding
   depression for survival, either before or after nutritional
   independence. By contrast, inbreeding was negatively associated with two
   quality-related traits, yearling body mass and annual male reproductive
   success. Yearling body mass was associated with f(ped) but not sMLH,
   while male annual reproductive success was best explained by both f(ped)
   and residual sMLH. Thus, our study not only uncovers variation in the
   extent to which different traits show inbreeding depression, but also
   reveals trait-specific differences in the ability of pedigrees and
   molecular markers to explain fitness variation and suggests that for
   certain traits, genetic markers may capture variation in realized IBDg
   above and beyond the pedigree expectation.}},

   of a large area from scattered local surveys within it, has attracted
   increasing interest in recent years, producing a wide range of competing
   approaches. Such methods, if successful, could have important
   applications to multi-scale biodiversity estimation and monitoring. Here
   we test 19 techniques using a high quality plant data set: the GB
   Countryside Survey 1999, detailed surveys of a stratified random sample
   of British landscapes. In addition to the full data set, a set of
   geographical and statistical subsets was created, allowing each method
   to be tested on multiple data sets with different characteristics. The
   predictions of the models were tested against the ``true{''}
   species-area relationship for British plants, derived from
   contemporaneously surveyed national atlas data. This represents a far
   more ambitious test than is usually employed, requiring 5-10 orders of
   magnitude in upscaling. The methods differed greatly in their
   performance; while there are 2,326 focal plant taxa recorded in the
   focal region, up-scaled species richness estimates ranged from 62 to
   11,593. Several models provided reasonably reliable results across the
   16 test data sets: the Shen and He and the Ulrich and Ollik models
   provided the most robust estimates of total species richness, with the
   former generally providing estimates within 10\% of the true value. The
   methods tested proved less accurate at estimating the shape of the
   species-area relationship (SAR) as a whole; the best single method was
   Hui's Occupancy Rank Curve approach, which erred on average by <20\%. A
   hybrid method combining a total species richness estimate (from the Shen
   and He model) with a downscaling approach (the Sizling model) proved
   more accurate in predicting the SAR (mean relative error 15.5\%) than
   any of the pure upscaling approaches tested. There remains substantial
   room for improvement in upscaling methods, but our results suggest that
   several existing methods have a high potential for practical application
   to estimating species richness at coarse spatial scales. The methods
   should greatly facilitate biodiversity estimation in poorly studied taxa
   and regions, and the monitoring of biodiversity change at multiple
   spatial scales.}},

   significant challenges for research, policy and management of
   ecosystems. Evidence suggests that high species diversity tends to
   increase plant community stability under interannual climate
   fluctuations and mild dry and wet events, but the overall pattern of
   diversity-stability relationships under climate extremes is unclear. We
   comprehensively review results from observational and experimental
   studies to assess the importance of diversity effects for ecosystem
   function under climate extremes. Both the broad literature review and a
   meta-analysis focused on the effects of extreme precipitation events on
   above-ground biomass reveal no significant interaction between species
   richness and climate extremes. Causes for variation in diversity effects
   under climate extremes are explored, from stress thresholds to biotic
   interactions and community assembly, and we consider how these may
   modulate the outcomes of biodiversity-stability relationships. We also
   examine how specific characteristics of climate extremes and timing of
   measurements may interact with mechanisms of diversity-stability
   relationships.Synthesis. Hypotheses tailored to the complexity of
   diversity effects, the implementation of standardised experiments and
   the use of trait-based biodiversity measures rather than species
   richness should lead to better causal understanding of whether and how
   biodiversity may protect ecosystems from adverse effects of climate

  abstract                   = {{1. The role of interspecific competition for generating patterns in
   species' distribution is hotly debated and studies taking into account
   processes occurring at both large and small spatial scales are almost
   missing. Theoretically, competition between species with overlapping
   niches should result in divergence of their niches in sympatry to reduce
   the costs of competition. Many species show a mosaic distribution within
   sympatric zones, with the syntopic sites occupied by both species, and
   allotopic sites where only one species occurs. It is unclear whether
   such mosaics arise as a consequence of competition-driven niche
   segregation or due to the decline of their abundances towards range
   edges driven by environmental gradients.
   2. If the interspecific competition matters, we should observe (1) a
   shift in habitat preferences of one or both species between syntopy and
   allotopy, and (2) between allopatry and allotopy. Moreover, (3) species
   should show greater divergence in their habitat preferences in allotopy
   than in allopatry where (4) no differences in habitat preferences may
   occur. Finally, (5) shifts should be generally greater in the
   competitively subordinate species than in the dominant species.
   3. We used a unique dataset on abundance of two closely related
   passerine species, the Common Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and
   the Thrush Nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), collected across their
   syntopy, allotopy and allopatry. The predictions were tested within a
   generalized mixed-effects modelling framework.
   4. After accounting for environmental gradients perpendicular to the
   species' contact zone, we found a strong support for all but one
   prediction. Habitat preferences of both species shifted markedly between
   syntopy and allotopy, as well as between allopatry and allotopy. Whereas
   the species preferred the same habitats in allopatry, their preferences
   became strikingly different in allotopy where the abundance of the
   Common Nightingale increased towards dry and warm sites with low
   coverage of pastures, while the abundance of the Thrush Nightingale
   showed exactly opposite trends. Fifth prediction was not supported.
   5. Our results indicate that the competition between closely related
   species can result in considerable changes in habitat use across their
   geographic ranges accompanied with divergence in their habitat
   preferences in sympatry. Here, the species ``escape{''} from competition
   to allotopic sites covered by habitats avoided by the competitor.
   Therefore, we argue that the interspecific competition is an important
   driver of species' distribution at both large and small spatial scales.}},

   functional diversity, niche partitioning and interspecific interactions.
   Identifying the direct and indirect interactions among sympatric
   carnivores that enable their coexistence is particularly important to
   elucidate because they are integral for maintaining ecosystem function.
   2. We studied the effects of removing nine fishers (Pekania pennanti) on
   their population dynamics and used this perturbation to elucidate the
   interspecific interactions among fishers, grey foxes (Urocyon
   cinereoargenteus) and ringtails (Bassariscus astutus). Grey foxes
   (family: Canidae) are likely to compete with fishers due to their
   similar body sizes and dietary overlap, and ringtails (family:
   Procyonidae), like fishers, are semi-arboreal species of conservation
   concern. We used spatial capture-recapture to investigate fisher
   population numbers and dynamic occupancy models that incorporated
   interspecific interactions to investigate the effects members of these
   species had on the colonization and persistence of each other's site
   occupancy.
   3. The fisher population showed no change in density for up to 3 years
   following the removals of fishers for translocations. In contrast,
   fisher site occupancy decreased in the years immediately following the
   translocations. During this same time period, site occupancy by grey
   foxes increased and remained elevated through the end of the study.
   4. We found a complicated hierarchy among fishers, foxes and ringtails.
   Fishers affected grey fox site persistence negatively but had a positive
   effect on their colonization. Foxes had a positive effect on ringtail
   site colonization. Thus, fishers were the dominant small carnivore where
   present and negatively affected foxes directly and ringtails indirectly.
   5. Coexistence among the small carnivores we studied appears to reflect
   dynamic spatial partitioning. Conservation and management efforts should
   investigate how intraguild interactions may influence the recolonization
   of carnivores to previously occupied landscapes.}},

   associational effects of focal plant individuals neighboured with
   different species. Spatial micropatterns between the focal plant and its
   neighbouring species within patches can affect herbivore foraging
   selectivity at within-and between-patch scales, which may consequently
   lead to associational plant effects occurring at both plant individual
   and population levels. However, these associational effects have not
   been explored together in the plant-herbivore interaction studies.
   2. We aim to evaluate how plant spatial micro-pattern within different
   quality patches mediate herbivore foraging selectivity, thereby
   affecting the associational effects of focal plant individuals and
   population.
   3. Using sheep as the model herbivore and a medium preferred species as
   the focal plant, we conducted a manipulative experiment by allowing
   sheep grazing freely among three different quality patches, each of
   which consisted of preferred, unpreferred and focal plant species with
   different abundances forming spatially aggregated or dispersed
   micro-patterns.
   4. Results showed that, compared with the aggregated plant
   micro-pattern, dispersed plant micro-patterns within different quality
   patches increased sheep within-patch selectivity, and caused diverse
   associational effects of focal plant individuals. Focal plant
   individuals experienced neighbour contrast defence (i.e. got protection
   in the high quality patch) and associational defence (i.e. got
   protection in the low quality patch), respectively, when plants
   distributed dispersedly in the low and high quality patch. Focal plant
   individuals simultaneously experienced associational susceptibility
   (i.e. got damage in the high quality patch) and neighbour contrast
   susceptibility (i.e. got damage in the low quality patch) when plants
   distributed dispersedly in the medium quality patch. Furthermore,
   dispersed plant micro-patterns reduced sheep foraging selectivity
   between patches, and led to a lower consumption of focal plant
   population compared with the aggregated plant micro-pattern.
   5. Herbivores adopt different within-and between-patch foraging
   decisions to maintain a high intake of the preferred species in response
   to various plant micro-patterns, and consequently cause diverse
   associational effects of both focal plant individuals and population.
   These associational effects have important implications for
   understanding the species coexistence and plant community assembly in
   the grazing ecosystems.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Habitat loss is the primary cause of local extinctions. Yet, there is
   considerable uncertainty regarding how fast species respond to habitat
   loss, and how time-delayed responses vary in space.
   2. We focused on the Argentine Dry Chaco (c. 32 million ha), a global
   deforestation hotspot, and tested for time-delayed response of bird and
   mammal communities to landscape transformation. We quantified the
   magnitude of extinction debt by modelling contemporary species richness
   as a function of either contemporary or past (2000 and 1985) landscape
   patterns. We then used these models to map communities' extinction debt.
   3. We found strong evidence for an extinction debt: landscape structure
   from 2000 explained contemporary species richness of birds and mammals
   better than contemporary and 1985 landscapes. This suggests time-delayed
   responses between 10 and 25 years. Extinction debt was especially strong
   for forest specialists.
   4. Projecting our models across the Chaco highlighted areas where future
   local extinctions due to unpaid extinction debt are likely. Areas
   recently converted to agriculture had highest extinction debt,
   regardless of the post-conversion land use. Few local extinctions were
   predicted in areas with remaining larger forest patches.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The evidence for an unpaid extinction
   debt in the Argentine Dry Chaco provides a substantial window of
   opportunity for averting local biodiversity losses. However, this window
   may close rapidly if conservation activities such as habitat restoration
   are not implemented swiftly. Our extinction debt maps highlight areas
   where such conservation activities should be implemented.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Invasive forest pathogens of the genus Phytophthora are threatening
   ecosystems globally. Phytophthora species are mainly introduced by
   humans importing infected nursery stock. However, due to the presence of
   environmental filters, not all introduced Phytophthoras manage to
   establish and spread. Phytophthoras' ability to overcome these filters
   may be linked to functional traits. In northern Europe, the increasing
   number of reports calls for a better understanding of the invasion
   process to prevent future outbreaks.
   2. We hypothesized that the incidence of invasive Phytophthoras in urban
   locations would be higher than in remote forests, that there would be a
   decrease of species richness along the invasion process because of
   environmental filtering, and that there would be a functional shift
   among Phytophthora communities between stages of invasion. We compared
   the species composition of 96 sites from 16 rivers running through areas
   that constitute a gradient of human influence. We also compared the
   species composition and functional diversity of Phytophthora communities
   in eight nurseries and 14 forests, including anthropogenic and natural
   forests. Phytophthoras were isolated from river water, soil and/or plant
   tissue. Cultures were identified based on the Internal Transcribed
   Spacer region.
   3. Three Phytophthoras were detected in all environments (Phytophthora
   cactorum, Phytophthora plurivora and Phytophthora cambivora). The
   incidence of these species was higher in urban locations than in remote
   forests, suggesting that human activities act as a driver of invasion.
   Most of the Phytophthoras detected in forests were detected in
   nurseries. The Phytophthora community in nurseries was richer and more
   diverse than in forests, pointing to environmental filtering affecting
   the establishment. Phytophthora communities in nurseries and forests
   differed in their functional divergence. Traits associated with
   establishment were the ability to form asexual survival structures and
   lower cardinal temperatures for growth.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings support the view that human
   activities act as drivers of Phytophthora invasions, and suggest that
   Phytophthoras able to form asexual structures are more likely to
   establish in northern Europe. The results increase the capacity to
   predict the establishment of Phytophthora species in Sweden and expand
   our understanding of the invasion process of forest pathogens.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Although pollution is a major driver of ecosystem change, models
   predicting the environmental fate of contaminants suffer from critical
   uncertainties related to oversimplifying the dynamics of the biological
   compartment.
   2. It is increasingly recognized that contaminant processing is an
   outcome of ecosystem functioning, that ecosystem functioning is
   contingent on community structure and that community structure is
   influenced by organismal dispersal. We propose a conceptual organization
   of the contribution of organismal dispersal to local contaminant fate.
   Direct dispersal effects occur when the dispersing organism directly
   couples contaminant stocks in spatially separate ecosystems by
   transporting contaminants in its biomass. Indirect dispersal effects
   occur when the dispersing organism indirectly influences contaminant
   fate via community assembly. This can occur either when the dispersing
   organism is a contaminant processor or when the dispersing organism
   alters, via species interactions, the abundance of contaminant
   biotransporters or processors already established in the ecosystem. The
   magnitude of direct and indirect dispersal effects is modulated by many
   factors, including other contaminants. These will influence population
   growth rates of the dispersing species in the donor ecosystem, or the
   probability that a dispersing individual reaches the recipient
   ecosystem.
   3. We provide a review of pertinent literature demonstrating that these
   two mechanisms, and their chemical modulation, are well supported or
   likely to occur in many natural and human-modified landscapes. The
   literature also demonstrates that they can operate in concert with each
   other.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Managed ecosystems thought to be
   important contaminant and nutrient sinks, such as artificial ponds and
   constructed wetlands, should be monitored and controlled for in-and-out
   animal movement if contaminant export is found to be relevant.
   Uncontaminated fishing grounds linked to contaminated sites via movement
   of dispersing species should be monitored and resident species evaluated
   for health consumption advisories. Assessing the success of contaminated
   site remediation can be improved by better matching the spatial extent
   of site remediation and the home range of monitored species. Finally,
   interagency research fund programmes should be developed that narrow the
   current gap between the fields of ecology and ecotoxicology.}},

   arbovirus transmission in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and can spread
   spatially through wild mosquito populations following local
   introductions. Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have
   demonstrated slower than expected spatial spread. Potential reasons for
   this include: (i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; (ii) higher
   incidence of long-range dispersal; and (iii) intergenerational loss of
   Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential factors using
   genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the
   Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in
   2015. We detected a small but significant barrier effect of Cairns
   highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy
   analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected a pair of
   putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312 m apart, indicating
   long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. We
   also found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status,
   indicating intergenerational loss of Wolbachia in the field. These three
   factors are all expected to contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia
   through Ae. aegypti populations, though from our results it is unclear
   whether Wolbachia loss and long-distance movement are sufficiently
   common to reduce the speed of spatial spread appreciably. Our findings
   inform the strategic deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes during
   releases, and show how parameter estimates from laboratory studies may
   differ from those estimated using field data. Our landscape genomics
   approach can be extended to other host/symbiont systems that are being

  abstract                   = {{Evolutionary theory predicts that the spread of cytoplasmic sex ratio
   distorters leads to the evolution of host nuclear suppressors, although
   there are extremely few empirical observations of this phenomenon. Here,
   we demonstrate that a nuclear suppressor of a cytoplasmic male killer
   has spread rapidly in a population of the green lacewing Mallada
   desjardinsi. An M. desjardinsi population, which was strongly
   female-biased in 2011 because of a high prevalence of the male-killing
   Spiroplasma endosymbiont, had a sex ratio near parity in 2016, despite a
   consistent Spiroplasma prevalence. Most of the offspring derived from
   individuals collected in 2016 had 1 : 1 sex ratios in subsequent
   generations. Contrastingly, all-female or female-biased broods appeared
   frequently from crossings of these female offspring with males derived
   from a laboratory line founded by individuals collected in 2011. These
   results suggest near-fixation of a nuclear suppressor against male
   killing in 2016 and reject the notion that a non-male-killing
   Spiroplasma variant has spread in the population. Consistently, no
   significant difference was detected in mitochondrial haplotype variation
   between 2011 and 2016. These findings, and earlier findings in the
   butterfly Hypolimnas bolina in Samoa, suggest that these quick events of
   male recovery occur more commonly than is generally appreciated.}},

   through changes to their food supply. These changes can involve a
   mis-timing between periods of high food demand and peak food
   availability, typically from advances in breeding phenology, and/or an
   overall reduction in food availability. Aerial insectivores, birds that
   feed on insects caught in flight, are experiencing steep population
   declines possibly because of shifts in the timing and/or abundance of
   aerial insects. We determined whether changes in breeding performance
   over time could account for declines in Bank Riparia riparia, Barn
   Hirundo rustica, Cliff Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, and Tree Tachycineta
   bicolor Swallows, and if so, whether changes were related to shifts in
   breeding phenology and/or climate change. We compared breeding
   performance and phenology in Maritime Canada before (1962-1972) and
   after (2006-2016) the onset of steep population declines during the
   mid-1980s, to determine whether breeding performance was reduced or
   phenology was advanced. Then, we modeled relationships between
   temperature, precipitation, breeding phenology, and performance for Barn
   and Tree Swallows, the only species with sufficient data, from 1960 to
   2016, to determine whether phenology and performance were related to
   climatic conditions. Between the two time periods, we found
   significantly lower performance in Bank Swallows, higher performance in
   Barn and Tree Swallows, and unchanged performance in Cliff Swallows. We
   also found clutch initiation dates advanced by 8-10 d for all species
   except Bank Swallows. On the breeding grounds, warmer winter
   temperatures for Tree Swallows and less winter precipitation for Barn
   and Tree Swallows in a given year were associated with earlier breeding,
   and for Tree Swallows, changes in nestling survival. Otherwise, Barn and
   Tree Swallow breeding performance was unaffected by winter temperature
   and precipitation. Our results suggest that in this region poorer

   understanding of ecology and evolution across diverse taxa and

   yet little is known about host-associated microbial assemblages within
   the phylum. Free-living nematodes are globally abundant and diverse in
   marine sediments, with species exhibiting distinct buccal cavity (mouth)
   morphologies that are thought to play an important role in feeding
   ecology and life history strategies. Here, we investigated patterns in
   marine nematode microbiomes, by characterizing host-associated microbial
   taxa in 281 worms isolated from a range of habitat types (deep-sea,
   shallow water, methane seeps, Lophelia coral mounds, kelp holdfasts)
   across three distinct geographic regions (Arctic, Southern California
   and Gulf of Mexico). Microbiome profiles were generated from single
   worms spanning 33 distinct morphological genera, using a two-gene
   metabarcoding approach to amplify the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA
   (rRNA) gene targeting bacteria/archaea and the V1-V2 region of the 18S
   rRNA gene targeting microbial eukaryotes. Contrary to our expectations,
   nematode microbiome profiles demonstrated no distinct patterns either
   globally (across depths and ocean basins) or locally (within site);
   prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial assemblages did not correlate with
   nematode feeding morphology, host phylogeny or morphological identity,
   ocean region or marine habitat type. However, fine-scale analysis of
   nematode microbiomes revealed a variety of novel ecological
   interactions, including putative parasites and symbionts, and potential
   associations with bacterial/archaeal taxa involved in nitrogen and
   methane cycling. Our results suggest that in marine habitats,
   free-living nematodes may utilize diverse and generalist foraging
   strategies that are not correlated with host genotype or feeding
   morphology. Furthermore, some abiotic factors such as geographic region
   and habitat type do not appear to play an obvious role in structuring
   host-microbe associations or feeding preferences.}},

   genetic drift due to demographic factors while also experiencing strong
   selective pressures. The paradigm that reduced genetic diversity should
   limit the evolutionary potential of invasive species, and thus, their
   potential for range expansion has received little empirical support,
   possibly due to the choice of genetic markers. Our goal was to test for
   effects of genetic drift and selection at functional genetic markers as
   they relate to the invasion success of two paired invasive goby species,
   one widespread (successful) and one with limited range expansion (less
   successful). We genotyped fish using two marker types: single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) in known-function, protein-coding genes and
   microsatellites to contrast the effects of neutral genetic processes. We
   identified reduced allelic variation in the invaded range for the less
   successful tubenose goby. SNPs putatively under selection were
   responsible for the observed differences in population structure between
   marker types for round goby (successful) but not tubenose goby (less
   successful). A higher proportion of functional loci experienced
   divergent selection for round goby, suggesting increased evolutionary
   potential in invaded ranges may be associated with round goby's greater
   invasion success. Genes involved in thermal tolerance were divergent for
   round goby populations but not tubenose goby, consistent with the

  abstract                   = {{1. The investigation of genetic clusters in natural populations is an
   ubiquitous problem in a range of fields relying on the analysis of
   genetic data, such as molecular ecology, conservation biology and
   microbiology. Typically, genetic clusters are defined as distinct
   panmictic populations, or parental groups in the context of
   hybridisation. Two types of methods have been developed for identifying
   such clusters: model-based methods, which are usually computer-intensive
   but yield results which can be interpreted in the light of an explicit
   population genetic model, and geometric approaches, which are less
   interpretable but remarkably faster.
   2. Here, we introduce snapclust, a fast maximum-likelihood solution to
   the genetic clustering problem, which allies the advantages of both
   model-based and geometric approaches. Our method relies on maximising
   the likelihood of a fixed number of panmictic populations, using a
   combination of geometric approach and fast likelihood optimisation,
   using the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. It can be used for
   assigning genotypes to populations and optionally identify various types
   of hybrids between two parental populations. Several goodness-of-fit
   statistics can also be used to guide the choice of the retained number
   of clusters.
   3. Using extensive simulations, we show that snapclust performs
   comparably to current gold standards for genetic clustering as well as
   hybrid detection, with some advantages for identifying hybrids after
   several backcrosses, while being orders of magnitude faster than other
   model-based methods. We also illustrate how snapclust can be used for
   identifying the optimal number of clusters, and subsequently assign
   individuals to various hybrid classes simulated from an empirical
   microsatellite dataset.
   4. snapclust is implemented in the package adegenet for the free
   software R, and is therefore easily integrated into existing pipelines
   for genetic data analysis. It can be applied to any kind of co-dominant
   markers, and can easily be extended to more complex models including,
   for instance, varying ploidy levels. Given its flexibility and
   computer-efficiency, it provides a useful complement to the existing
   toolbox for the study of genetic diversity in natural populations.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Plant roots and the associated mycorrhizal fungal hyphae often
   selectively proliferate into patchily distributed soil nutrient
   hotspots, but interactions between these two components of a mycorrhizal
   root system are usually ignored or experimentally isolated in nutrient
   foraging studies.
   2. From studies in which both roots and mycorrhizal hyphae had access to
   nutrient hotspots, we compiled data on root foraging precision (increase
   in roots in nutrient hotspots relative to outside hotspots) of plant
   species from different ecosystems, ranging from temperate grasslands to
   subtropical forests. We found that root foraging precision across the
   wide range of plant species was strongly influenced by root morphology
   and mycorrhizal type.
   3. The precision of root nutrient foraging, as a plant functional trait,
   may coordinate with other root traits that are related to the economics
   of nutrient acquisition. High foraging precision is expected to
   associate with the strategy of fast return on the investment in roots,
   such as low construction cost, high metabolic rate and rapid turnover.
   4. Nutrient foraging by mycorrhizal fungi alone may be influenced by
   functional traits such as hyphal exploration distance, hyphal turnover,
   and hyphal uptake capacity and efficiency, but such data are limited to
   a small portion of mycorrhizal fungal species.
   5. We propose a conceptual framework in which to simulate nitrogen and
   phosphorus acquisition from both nutrient hotspots and outside hotspots
   in mixed-species plant communities. Simulation outputs suggest that
   plant species with varying root morphology and mycorrhizal type can be
   adaptive to a range of nutrient heterogeneity.
   6. Although there are still knowledge gaps related to nutrient foraging,
   as well as many unexplored plant and fungal species, we suggest that
   scaling nutrient foraging from individual plants to communities would
   advance understanding of plant species interactions and below-ground
   ecosystem function.}},

   in competitive exclusion of the inferior competitor. In natural
   communities, however, other antagonists and symbionts moderate
   competition. Thus, we have to go beyond studying pairwise interactions.
   Natural enemies may facilitate coexistence if they affect the superior
   competitor more strongly, or they can hinder coexistence via apparent
   competition. Less well studied is the role of symbionts, which may
   influence species coexistence in conjunction with enemies.
   Eukaryotes commonly harbour microbial endosymbionts that provide
   protection against natural enemies, but are costly in their absence.
   Such defensive symbionts could thus mediate coexistence of species
   competing for the same resource, both in the presence and in the absence
   of enemies, but as yet there is little evidence for this claim.
   We addressed this proposed role of defensive symbionts in replicated
   simple communities consisting of two aphid species sharing the same host
   plant and the same natural enemy, a parasitoid wasp. Both, one, or
   neither species were infected with a resistance-conferring symbiont, and
   they competed in the absence as well as the presence of parasitoids.
   The symbiont had significant effects in the absence of parasitoids by
   lowering competitive ability especially in one species, but the effects
   were more dramatic in the presence of parasitoids. With both species
   protected by the symbiont, parasitoid densities remained low and both
   aphid species persisted. When neither species was protected, parasitoids
   drove both species to extinction. Surprisingly, the same outcome was
   observed when only one species was protected. The susceptible species
   supported high densities of parasitoids that also killed the resistant
   aphids via mechanisms other than parasitism, presumably by disturbing
   them to the point of starvation. This is an intriguing form of apparent
   competition.
   Our results demonstrate an important role of defensive symbionts in
   insect communities through modifying species interactions. This
   highlights the need for experimental data when studying species
   coexistence in competitive networks. Furthermore, the observation that a
   susceptible host can negatively affect a resistant host via a shared
   parasitoid is an instructive insight for biological control.}},

   surveys, salt tolerance and competition experiments to develop a
   predictive model interspecific interaction shifts across salinity stress
   gradients. Field survey and greenhouse tolerance tests revealed
   tradeoffs between stress tolerance and competitive ability. Modeling
   showed that along salinity gradients, (1) plant interactions shifted
   from competition to facilitation at high salinities within the
   physiological limits of salt-intolerant plants, (2) facilitation
   collapsed when salinity stress exceeded the physiological tolerance of
   salt-intolerant plants, and (3) neighbor removal experiments
   overestimate interspecific facilitation by including intraspecific
   effects. A community-level field experiment, suggested that (1) species
   interactions are competitive in benign and, facilitative in harsh
   condition, but fuzzy under medium environmental stress due to niche
   differences of species and weak stress amelioration, and (2) the SGH
   works on strong but not weak stress gradients, so SGH confusion arises

  abstract                   = {{In Africa, extensively raised livestock populations in most smallholder
   farming communities are exposed to harsh and heterogeneous climatic
   conditions and disease pathogens that they adapt to in order to survive.
   Majority of these livestock species, including goats, are of
   non-descript and uncharacterized breeds and their response to natural
   selection presented by heterogeneous environments is still unresolved.
   This study investigated genetic diversity and its association with
   environmental and geographic conditions in 194 South African indigenous
   goats from different geographic locations genotyped on the Illumina goat
   SNP50K panel. Population structure analysis revealed a homogeneous
   genetic cluster of the Tankwa goats, restricted to the Northern Cape
   province. Overall, the Boer, Kalahari Red, and Savanna showed a wide
   geographic spread of shared genetic components, whereas the village
   ecotypes revealed a longitudinal distribution. The relative importance
   of environmental factors on genetic variation of goat populations was
   assessed using redundancy analysis (RDA). Climatic and geographic
   variables explained 22\% of the total variation while climatic variables
   alone accounted for 17\% of the diversity. Geographic variables
   solitarily explained 1\% of the total variation. The first axis (Model
   I) of the RDA analysis revealed 329 outlier SNPs. Landscape genomic
   approaches of spatial analysis method (SAM) identified a total of 843
   (1.75\%) SNPs, while latent factor mixed models (LFMM) identified 714
   (1.48\%) SNPs significantly associated with environmental variables.
   Significant markers were within genes involved in biological functions
   potentially important for environmental adaptation. Overall, the study
   suggested environmental factors to have some effect in shaping the
   genetic variation of South African indigenous goat populations. Loci
   observed to be significant and under selection may be responsible for
   the adaption of the goat populations to local production systems.}},

   remains high even in those coral species listed as threatened. While
   this is good news in many ways, it presents a challenge for the
   development of biomarkers that can identify resilient or vulnerable
   genotypes. Taking advantage of three coral restoration nurseries in
   Florida that serve as long-term common garden experiments, we exposed
   over 30 genetically distinct Acropora cervicornis colonies to hot and
   cold temperature shocks seasonally and measured pooled gene expression
   responses using RNAseq. Targeting a subset of 20 genes, we designed a
   high-throughput qPCR array to quantify expression in all individuals
   separately under each treatment with the goal of identifying predictive
   and/or diagnostic thermal stress biomarkers. We observed extensive
   transcriptional variation in the population, suggesting abundant raw
   material is available for adaptation via natural selection. However,
   this high variation made it difficult to correlate gene expression
   changes with colony performance metrics such as growth, mortality and
   bleaching susceptibility. Nevertheless, we identified several promising
   diagnostic biomarkers for acute thermal stress that may improve coral
   restoration and climate change mitigation efforts in the future.}},

   selection. We found striking variability in both the use and reporting
   of environmental data and statistical parameters. For example, linkage
   disequilibrium among SNPs and numbers of unique SNP associations
   identified with EAA were rarely reported. The proportion of putatively
   adaptive SNPs detected varied widely among studies, and decreased with
   the number of SNPs analysed. We found that genomic sampling effort had a
   greater impact than biological sampling effort on the proportion of
   identified SNPs under selection. OA identified a higher proportion of
   outliers when more individuals were sampled, but this was not the case
   for EAA. To facilitate repeatability, interpretation and synthesis of
   studies detecting selection, we recommend that future studies
   consistently report geographical coordinates, environmental data, model
   parameters, linkage disequilibrium, and measures of genetic structure.
   Identifying standards for how OA and EAA studies are designed and
   reported will aid future transparency and comparability of SNP-based
   selection studies and help to progress landscape and evolutionary
   genomics.}},

  abstract                   = {{Urban areas are highly fragmented and thereby exert strong constraints
   on individual dispersal. Despite this, some species manage to persist in
   urban areas, such as the garden snail, Cornu aspersum, which is common
   in cityscapes despite its low mobility. Using landscape genetic
   approaches, we combined study area replication and multiscale analysis
   to determine how landscape composition, configuration and connectivity
   influence snail dispersal across urban areas. At the overall landscape
   scale, areas with a high percentage of roads decreased genetic
   differentiation between populations. At the population scale, genetic
   differentiation was positively linked with building surface, the
   proportion of borders where wooded patches and roads appeared side by
   side and the proportion of borders combining wooded patches and other
   impervious areas. Analyses based on pairwise genetic distances validated
   the isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-resistance models for this
   land snail, with an equal fit to least-cost paths and
   circuit-theory-based models. Each of the 12 landscapes analysed
   separately yielded specific relations to environmental features, whereas
   analyses integrating all replicates highlighted general common effects.
   Our results suggest that urban transport infrastructures facilitate
   passive snail dispersal. At a local scale, corresponding to active
   dispersal, unfavourable habitats (wooded and impervious areas) isolate
   populations. This work upholds the use of replicated landscapes to
   increase the generalizability of landscape genetics results and shows
   how multiscale analyses provide insight into scale-dependent processes.}},

   influence offspring performance, recent research on adaptive parental
   effects has focused primarily on anticipatory effects, whereby parents
   adjust the phenotype of their offspring for the anticipated environment.
   Here, we make the case that condition transfer is a widespread and
   important type of adaptive parental effect, and endeavour to clarify how
   such effects should be interpreted and studied. Some authors have
   suggested that condition-transfer effects result simply from resource
   limitation constraints (passive condition transfer, or transmissive
   effects). However, condition transfer can also reflect evolved parental
   investment strategies (active condition-transfer effects). In some
   species, such strategies can involve cryptic mechanisms such as
   epigenetic inheritance. As recently shown in this journal by Engqvist
   and Reinhold, condition-transfer effects can be obscured by anticipatory
   effects and interactions between the effects of parental and offspring
   environments. Nonetheless, we argue that these complications can be
   largely overcome by examining a broad range of ecologically relevant
   environments in both parental and offspring generations. This can be
   accomplished by adapting a powerful methodology from the nutritional
   sciencesthe geometric frameworkto research on parental effects.}},

   states that body size increases with decreasing temperature and
   increasing latitude, although the rule is not universal and the proposed
   mechanisms underpinning it are multifarious and lack congruence. This
   study considers the degree to which Bergmann's rule applies to the
   Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish community. We studied patterns in body
   size, temperature, and latitude across a 127 latitudinal gradient within
   the Scotia-Weddell sector. Intraspecific Bergmann's rule was found to
   apply to 8 of the 11 biomass-dominant species in the family Myctophidae.
   The rule was also apparent at an interspecific level. Our study suggests
   that greater attainable body size in this community is a necessary
   attribute to reach colder regions further south. The adherence of these
   taxa to Bergmann's rule enables such species to act as sentinels for
   identifying the drivers and consequences of ocean warming for the

   with opisthosoma preserved in strong lateral bends are documented,
   bolstering the evidence for potential lateral tail striking among
   various eurypterid species. Contrary to dissenting suggestions, such
   specimens remain fully articulated, and the opisthosoma exoskeleton of
   many eurypterids appears adapted to permit a wide range of lateral
   motion. Observation of long telson spines and prominent dorsal telson
   keels across the Eurypterida reveals that the two traits are negatively
   correlated. This indicates that the function of a spiniform telson was
   incompatible with an opisthosoma that generated strong lateral hydraulic
   resistance and therefore supports the hypothesis that, when present,
   eurypterids may have used their long telson spines as laterally striking
   weapons.}},

   nutrient cycling. Although the majority of the terrestrial biodiversity
   is hidden in soils, very little is known about the importance of the
   diversity of microbial communities for soil functioning. Here, we tested
   effects of biodiversity on the functioning of methanotrophs, a
   specialized group of soil bacteria that plays a key role in mediating
   greenhouse gas emissions from soils. Using pure strains of
   methanotrophic bacteria, we assembled artificial communities of
   different diversity levels, with which we inoculated sterile soil
   microcosms. To assess the functioning of these communities, we measured
   methane oxidation by gas chromatography throughout the experiment and
   determined changes in community composition and community size at
   several time points by quantitative PCR and sequencing. We demonstrate
   that microbial diversity had a positive overyielding effect on methane
   oxidation, in particular at the beginning of the experiment. This higher
   assimilation of CH4 at high diversity translated into increased growth
   and significantly larger communities towards the end of the study. The
   overyielding of mixtures with respect to CH4 consumption and community
   size were positively correlated. The temporal CH4 consumption profiles
   of strain monocultures differed, raising the possibility that temporal
   complementarity of component strains drove the observed community-level
   strain richness effects; however, the community niche metric we derived
   from the temporal activity profiles did not explain the observed strain
   richness effect. The strain richness effect also was unrelated to both
   the phylogenetic and functional trait diversity of mixed communities.
   Overall, our results suggest that positive
   biodiversity-ecosystem-function relationships show similar patterns
   across different scales and may be widespread in nature. Additionally,
   biodiversity is probably also important in natural methanotrophic
   communities for the ecosystem function methane oxidation. Therefore,
   maintaining soil conditions that support a high diversity of
   methanotrophs may help to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas
   methane.}},

   changes are typically driven by macro-mutations such as whole genome
   duplications (WGDs) and proliferation of repetitive elements. These two
   processes may affect the evolutionary potential of lineages by
   increasing genetic variation and changing gene expression. Here, we
   elucidate the evolutionary history and mechanisms underpinning genome
   size variation in a species-rich group of Neotropical catfishes
   (Corydoradinae) with extreme variation in genome size-0.6 to 4.4 pg per
   haploid cell. First, genome size was quantified in 65 species and mapped
   onto a novel fossil-calibrated phylogeny. Two evolution ary shifts in
   genome size were identified across the tree-the first between 43 and 49
   Ma (95\% highest posterior density (HPD) 36.2-68.1 Ma) and the second at
   approximately 19 Ma (95\% HPD 15.3-30.14 Ma). Second, restriction-site
   associated DNA (RAD) sequencing was used to identify potential WGD
   events and quantify transposable element (TE) abundance in different
   lineages. Evidence of two lineage-scale WGDs was identified across the
   phylogeny, the first event occurring between 54 and 66 Ma (95\% HPD
   42.56-99.5 Ma) and the second at 20-30 Ma (95\% HPD 15.3-45 Ma) based on
   haplotype numbers per contig and between 35 and 44 Ma (95\% HPD
   30.29-64.51 Ma) and 20-30 Ma (95\% HPD 15.3-45 Ma) based on SNP read
   ratios. TE abundance increased considerably in parallel with genome
   size, with a single TE-family (TC1-IS630-Pogo) showing several increases
   across the Corydoradinae, with the most recent at 20-30 Ma (95\% HPD
   15.3-45 Ma) and an older event at 35-44 Ma (95\% HPD 30.29-64.51 Ma). We
   identified signals congruent with two WGD duplication events, as well as
   an increase in TE abundance across different lineages, making the
   Corydoradinae an excellent model system to study the effects of WGD and
   TEs on genome and organismal evolution.}},

   available N for pristine ecosystems such as subarctic and arctic tundra.
   Although this has been acknowledged more than a decade ago, few attempts
   have been undertaken to identify the foremost driver of N-2 fixation in
   the high Arctic. Here, we report results from in situ measurements of
   N-2 fixation throughout the main growing period (June-August) in high
   arctic tundra, Greenland, in climate change treatments, shading and
   warming, and control. Nitrogen fixation was also measured in cores that
   received additional water prior to the measurements. The climate change
   field treatments did not lead to significant changes in any measured
   parameters; however, N-2 fixation was promoted by adding water, and
   moisture was the most important factor influencing N-2 fixation in all
   climate change field treatments. Maximum N-2 fixation rates were
   measured below 14 degrees C soil temperature, which is much lower than
   the theoretical and previously reported temperature optimum for the
   nitrogenase enzyme. Diazotroph (N-2 fixing bacteria) communities are
   adapted to low temperatures in high arctic settings, and increased
   temperature in a future climate may lead to decreased N-2 fixation
   rates, or to a shift in diazotroph communities.}},

   skeletal regionalization are not well understood. Here, we investigate
   the evolution of tail weaponry in amniotes, a rare form of weaponry that
   nonetheless evolved independently among a broad spectrum of life
   including mammals, turtles and dinosaurs. Using phylogenetic comparative
   methods, we test for links between morphology, ecology and behaviour in
   extant amniotes known to use the tail as a weapon, and in extinct taxa
   bearing osseous tail armaments. We find robust ecological and
   morphological correlates of both tail lashing behaviour and bony tail
   weaponry, including large body size, body armour and herbivory,
   suggesting these life-history parameters factor into the evolution of
   antipredator behaviours and tail armaments. We suggest that the
   evolution of tail weaponry is rare because large, armoured herbivores
   are uncommon in extant terrestrial faunas, as they have been throughout
   evolutionary history.}},

   with other advanced cognitive skills, has fuelled the evolution of human
   culture. Comparative evidence has revealed that although the ability to
   copy sounds from conspecifics is mostly uniquely human among primates, a
   few distantly related taxa of birds and mammals have also independently
   evolved this capacity. Remarkably, field observations of killer whales
   have documented the existence of group-differentiated vocal dialects
   that are often referred to as traditions or cultures and are
   hypothesized to be acquired non-genetically. Here we use a do-as-I-do
   paradigm to study the abilities of a killer whale to imitate novel
   sounds uttered by conspecific (vocal imitative learning) and human
   models (vocal mimicry). We found that the subject made recognizable
   copies of all familiar and novel conspecific and human sounds tested and
   did so relatively quickly (most during the first 10 trials and three in
   the first attempt). Our results lend support to the hypothesis that the
   vocal variants observed in natural populations of this species can be
   socially learned by imitation. The capacity for vocal imitation shown in
   this study may scaffold the natural vocal traditions of killer whales in
   the wild.}},

   differences are expected if male and female signalling behaviours
   differ. Fireflies are known for their light displays, but many species
   communicate exclusively with pheromones, including species that recently
   lost their light signals. We performed phylogenetically controlled
   analyses of male eye and antenna size in 46 North American taxa, and
   found that light signals are associated with larger eyes and shorter
   antennae. In addition, following a transition from nocturnal light
   displays to diurnal pheromones, eye size reductions occur more rapidly
   than antenna size increases. In agreement with the North American taxa,
   across 101 worldwide firefly taxa in 32 genera, we found light displays
   are associated with larger eye and smaller antenna sizes in both males

   substrate is a key competitive innovation in benthic metazoans. Here we
   describe the substrate growth dynamics, mode of biomineralization and
   possible affinity of Namapoikia rietoogensis, a large (up to 1 m),
   robustly skeletal, and modular Ediacaran metazoan which encrusted the
   walls of synsedimentary fissures within microbial-metazoan reefs.
   Namapoikia formed laminar or domal morphologies with an internal
   structure of open tubules and transverse elements, and had a very
   plastic, non-deterministic growth form which could encrust both fully
   lithified surfaces as well as living microbial substrates, the latter
   via modified skeletal holdfasts. Namapoikia shows complex growth
   interactions and substrate competition with contemporary living
   microbialites and thrombolites, including the production of plate-like
   dissepiments in response to microbial overgrowth which served to elevate
   soft tissue above the microbial surface. Namapoikia could also recover
   from partial mortality due to microbial fouling. We infer initial
   skeletal growth to have propagated via the rapid formation of an organic
   scaffold via a basal pinacoderm prior to calcification. This is likely
   an ancient mode of biomineralization with similarities to the living
   calcified demosponge Vaceletia. Namapoikia also shows inferred skeletal
   growth banding which, combined with its large size, implies notable
   individual longevity. In sum, Namapoikia was a large, relatively
   long-lived Ediacaran clonal skeletal metazoan that propagated via an
   organic scaffold prior to calcification, enabling rapid, effective and
   dynamic substrate occupation and competition in cryptic reef settings.
   The open tubular internal structure, highly flexible, non-deterministic
   skeletal organization, and inferred style of biomineralization of
   Namapoikia places probable affinity within total-group poriferans.}},

   example, redistributing resources could modify habitats favorably for
   other organisms. We examined Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) den use by
   lemmings, their primary prey, in winter during a year of low lemming
   densities. We found winter nests, which are built by lemmings under
   snow, on 69\% of fox dens, whereas no control sites had nests. In
   August, dens had twice the vegetation cover and 50\% greater nitrogen
   content in grass than controls, suggesting soil enrichment by foxes
   increased food quantity and quality for herbivores. Snow was similar to
   4 times thicker in April on dens than controls, and 1.4 times thicker on
   dens with lemming nests than dens without, suggesting lemmings choose
   thicker snow for thermal insulation. Snow cover thickness was positively
   related to vegetation cover on dens, but not on control sites. Thus,
   Arctic foxes not only prey on lemmings but also engineer productive
   habitat that attracts lemmings. During winters with low lemming
   densities, when foxes often leave the denning area and predation risk is
   lower, fox dens may provide a refuge that could buffer the effects of
   deteriorating snow conditions with Arctic warming. This additional
   mechanism of predators interacting with their prey illustrates how
   ecosystem engineers potentially alter food web interactions and

   freshwater ecosystems, as well as macrophyte growth and reproduction.
   Although the trade-off between allocation to clonal and sexual
   reproduction in clonal plants can be influenced by a variety of
   environmental factors, whether variations of reproductive allocation
   (RA) in response to different environments are driven only by a
   size-dependent effect (apparent plasticity) or whether RA can also
   change independently of plant size (true plasticity) is uncertain. We
   conducted an experiment in nine outdoor mesocosms (6400L) to investigate
   the response of clonal and sexual reproduction and vegetative growth of
   a perennial submerged macrophyte Vallisneria spinulosa at water depths
   of 50, 100, or 150cm. We evaluated size-dependent and size-independent
   effects of water depth on sexual and clonal RA. Deep water reduced
   vegetative size and sexual output (mass of fruits produced), but
   increased tuber production of V. spinulosa. There was an apparent
   trade-off between reproductive modes in terms of biomass investment;
   plants in deep water allocated more resources into clonal propagation
   and reduced investment in sexual reproduction compared to plants in
   shallow or intermediate water. Slopes of allometric relationships
   (sexual vs. vegetative biomass and clonal vs. vegetative biomass) were
   significantly affected by water depth. Shifts in sexual RA in response
   to varying water depths were largely size-dependent, but there were also
   size-independent effects. In contrast, size-independent effects were
   more important than effects of size changes in determining clonal RA. We
   concluded that V.spinulosa adapted to a water-depth gradient by plastic
   trade-offs between clonal propagation and sexual reproduction.
   Furthermore, a size-independent effect on RA suggests a flexible
   reproductive strategy that could be critical for plant performance in
   changing aquatic environments.}},

   patterns of biodiversity, its effect on insect communities at higher
   trophic levels such as parasitoids remains poorly understood. This is
   particularly true in continuously distributed forests in which it can be
   difficult to identify clear boundaries among habitat patches. Using the
   metacommunity framework, we evaluate the relative importance of forest
   landscape structure, non-environmental spatial structure, and host
   outbreak status to spatial and within-season temporal variation in
   parasitoid communities. We used variation partitioning and metacommunity
   structure analyses to identify (1) the drivers of the metacommunity
   structure of parasitoids associated with the spruce budworm
   (Choristoneura fumiferana), and (2) how their relative influence varies
   through a season. We used a multi-scale perspective to summarize
   landscape heterogeneity in regions of increasing size around the
   community sampling locations. Spruce budworm larvae and pupae were
   sampled during three periods during the summer 2014 in 18 locations
   within continuous forest landscapes in Quebec, Canada. Thirty-two
   parasitoid wasp and fly species were recorded, 16 of which were found at
   more than one location. We found that the mechanisms shaping
   metacommunity structure changed over the course of a single season and
   that community structure varied among sites. At early and late periods
   in the season, we found that non-environmental structure, forest
   structure, and likely inter-specific competition were the main
   mechanisms influencing spatial variation in community structure. These
   results suggest a competition-dispersal trade-off. In contrast, at the
   middle period of the season, environmental filtering by forest structure
   and stochastic events were found to influence community structure. This
   period corresponds to the transition between early and late parasitoid
   communities. Our findings on the role of environmental filtering and
   forest structure support the idea that forest manipulations have the
   potential to influence parasitoid populations and hence spruce budworm
   outbreak dynamics as hypothesized by the enemies hypothesis. Moreover,
   our study highlights the value of considering a multi-scale approach and
   temporal variability of species interactions when characterizing the
   multiple processes shaping spatial metacommunity structure, particularly
   in continuous environments.}},

   development of bioinformatics tools, genome assembly and annotation have
   become accessible to many researchers in recent years. Among tetrapods,
   birds have genomes that display many features that facilitate their
   assembly and annotation, such as small genome size, low number of
   repeats and highly conserved genomic structure. However, we found that
   high genomic heterozygosity could have a great impact on the quality of
   the genome assembly of the thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia), an arctic
   colonial seabird. In this study, we tested the performance of three
   genome assemblers, ray/sscape, soapdenovo2 and platanus, in assembling
   the highly heterozygous genome of the thick-billed murre. Our results
   show that platanus, an assembler specifically designed for heterozygous
   genomes, outperforms the other two approaches and produces a highly
   contiguous (N50 = 15.8Mb) and complete genome assembly (93\% presence of
   genes from the Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Ortholog {[}BUSCO]
   gene set). Additionally, we annotated the thick-billed murre genome
   using a homology-based approach that takes advantage of the genomic
   resources available for birds and other taxa. Our study will be useful
   for those researchers who are approaching assembly and annotation of
   highly heterozygous genomes, or genomes of species of conservation
   concern, and/or who have limited financial resources.}},

   gain an in-depth understanding of social issues. The method aims to
   obtain data from a purposely selected group of individuals rather than
   from a statistically representative sample of a broader population. Even
   though the application of this method in conservation research has been
   extensive, there are no critical assessment of the application of the
   technique. In addition, there are no readily available guidelines for
   conservation researchers. Here, we reviewed the applications of focus
   group discussion within biodiversity and conservation research between
   1996 and April 2017. We begin with a brief explanation of the technique
   for first-time users. We then discuss in detail the empirical
   applications of this technique in conservation based on a structured
   literature review (using Scopus). The screening process resulted in 170
   articles, the majority of which (67\%, n=114,) were published between
   2011 and 2017. Rarely was the method used as a stand-alone technique.
   The number of participants per focus group (where reported) ranged from
   3 to 21 participants with a median of 10 participants. There were seven
   (median) focus group meetings per study. Focus group discussion sessions
   lasted for 90 (median) minutes. Four main themes emerged from the
   review: understanding of people's perspectives regarding conservation
   (32\%), followed by the assessment of conservation and livelihoods
   practices (21\%), examination of challenges and impacts of resource
   management interventions (19\%) and documenting the value of indigenous
   knowledge systems (16\%). Most of the studies were in Africa (n=76),
   followed by Asia (n=44), and Europe (n=30). We noted serious gaps in the
   reporting of the methodological details in the reviewed papers. More
   than half of the studies (n=101) did not report the sample size and
   group size (n=93), whereas 54 studies did not mention the number of
   focus group discussion sessions while reporting results. Rarely have the
   studies provided any information on the rationale for choosing the
   technique. We have provided guidelines to improve the standard of
   reporting and future application of the technique for conservation.}},

  abstract                   = {{Many indices have been proposed to measure functional diversity and its
   four distinct dimensions: functional richness, evenness, divergence and
   redundancy. Identifying indices that reliably measure the functional
   diversity dimension(s) of interest requires careful testing of how each
   index responds to species' traits and abundance distributions. In the
   absence of a convenient simulation tool, tests with artificial data have
   to date explored only a limited number of scenarios or have altered
   trait and abundance distributions only indirectly based on principles of
   evolution and community assembly. We provide simul.comms, an R function
   that allows users to test the efficacy of functional diversity indices
   by easily creating artificial species communities with user-specified
   abundance and trait distributions for continuous, ordinal and
   categorical traits. To illustrate the function's utility, we examine the
   performance of R, a recently published abundance-sensitive index for
   functional redundancy. We use two approaches to designing simulation
   tests for this example analysis. The first uses simul.comms to create
   six separate sets of artificial communities to qualitatively assess how
   R responds to predictable changes in functional redundancy. The second
   uses simul.comms to independently alter seven community composition
   parameters, whose influence on R is then examined quantitatively via
   effect sizes in linear regression. Our analyses indicate that R broadly
   mirrors expected changes in functional redundancy and predictably
   responds to changes in community composition parameters. R appears,
   however, to primarily reflect trait distributions, responding minimally
   to variance in abundance and counter-intuitively to abundance range.
   Further refinement of tools to measure functional redundancy may
   therefore be desirable. The R tool we provide should assist with
   refining functional diversity measures, a critical step towards
   improving our ability to understand and mitigate the impacts of
   biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. Because simul.comms simply
   produces two linked matrices, a species-by-traits matrix and a
   site-by-species abundance matrix, it may be equally valuable in
   exploring questions and analytical approaches in other areas of
   community ecology.}},

   leaf anatomical traits were closely related to gross primary
   productivity (GPP) because photosynthesis commonly occurs in the
   chloroplasts of palisade and spongy tissues in leaf. Eight leaf
   anatomical traits were measured in 916 plant species inhabiting from
   tropical to cold-temperate forests in eastern China: adaxial epidermis
   thickness (AD), abaxial epidermis thickness (AB), leaf thickness (LT),
   palisade tissue thickness (PT), and spongy tissue thickness (ST),
   palisade-spongy tissue ratio (PT/ST), palisade tissue-leaf thickness
   ratio (PT/LT), and spongy tissue-leaf thickness ratio (ST/LT). Leaf
   anatomical traits showed significant latitudinal patterns at species,
   plant functional group (PFG), and community levels (p<.05), and they
   differed between PFG and community. Temperature and precipitation were
   the main factors influencing AD, AB, PT/ST, and PT/LT, explaining
   33-72\% of the total variation at large scale. Furthermore, AB, LT,
   PT/ST, and PT/LT were significantly correlated with the aridity index.
   Our findings filled the data gap of plant anatomical traits at regional
   scales, and broadened current knowledge on the adaptation strategies of
   plant anatomical traits, which also provided new evidence for linkages
   of plant traits and functioning across natural communities.

   processes controlling the availability of soil ammonium (NH4+), a key
   nutrient for vegetative growth. The large-scale patterns of gross
   ammonification (GA) and gross nitrification (GN) rates represent soil
   microbial adaptations to different vegetative and environmental
   conditions. In this study, we investigated GA and GN rates in nine
   forest soils along a 3,700-km north-south transect in eastern China. We
   used N-15-labelling techniques, along with field experiments and
   laboratory incubations, to assess in situ and potential rates of the GA
   and GN. The mean in situ GA rate was 4.90.5mg Nkg(-1)day(-1), whereas
   the mean potential rate of GA was 32.08.6mg Nkg(-1)day(-1). The mean in
   situ GN rate was 1.7 +/- 0.3mg Nkg(-1)day(-1) (potential GN rate: 3.2
   +/- 0.6mg Nkg(-1)day(-1)). GA was significantly higher than GN along the
   transect, and there were high variations in GA and GN among different
   forests. Significant relationships were identified between
   meteorological factors (temperature and precipitation) and the GA and GN
   rates during the sampling month (August 2013). However, the mean GA rate
   in primary forest was significantly lower in the Huzhong (HZ), Dongling
   (DL), Taiyue (TY) and Dinghu (DH) sites compared with other sites,
   whereas with the exception of the Liangshui (LS) sampling site, the mean
   GN rate in primary and secondary forests showed the same trends.
   Significant differences in GA rates were found between primary and
   secondary forests at the LS and Changbai (CB) sites, and differences
   were detected in GN rate at the HZ, LS and Jiulian (JL) sites.
   Structural equation modelling analysis suggested that soil N contents,
   microbial biomass N pool sizes and bacterial abundance are the primary
   determinants of the in situ rates of GA and GN. The strong control of
   edaphic factors on GA and GN indicates a need to improve soil N models
   with more explicit representation of edaphic factors and their control
   on soil N transformations.

   can help uncover mechanisms of shrub-grass interactions and assess the
   validity of the stress-gradient hypothesis, which predicts that
   facilitation between plants increases in stressful environments.
   However, how facilitation via shrub-mediated nutrient increases varies
   with precipitation is poorly resolved. We first synthesized a global
   dataset from 66 studies and evaluated how shrubs affected soil organic
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in grasslands along a precipitation
   gradient. We then made new measurements in a single-grassland type
   encroached by leguminous shrubs from the same genus (Caragana) to
   constrain the variations caused by combining different grassland types
   and shrubs traits in the meta-analysis. Specifically, we investigated
   how shrubs mediated N dynamics and how shrub-grass interactions varied
   along a precipitation gradient (147-342mm) in a temperate steppe of
   China. At the global scale, leguminous shrub-mediated effects on soil
   nutrients increased with precipitation, while no relationship was found
   for non-leguminous shrub. For the field experiment, greater N and lower
   N-15 in Caragana compared to non-leguminous shrub (reference shrub,
   Salsola collina) suggested active N-fixation in Caragana. We found that
   Caragana enhanced N concentration and leaf quality (low C:N ratio) in
   neighbouring plants more on mesic sites than on xeric sites. Thus,
   facilitation increased via higher soil N and with decreasing
   environmental stress, at least along this relatively arid precipitation
   gradient. Our results highlight the importance of precipitation in
   determining the nutritional facilitation to neighbouring grasses from
   encroaching leguminous shrubs. Conceptual frameworks for plant
   facilitation may therefore need to include shrub characteristics
   (N-fixers vs. non-fixers) and positive effects of higher precipitation
   on this type of facilitation to characterize plant interactions along
   stress gradients.

   but little is known about the interaction of genome size with other
   traits or about the role of genome size during different phases of the
   invasion process. By intercontinental comparison of native and invasive
   populations of the common reed Phragmites australis, we revealed a
   distinct relationship between genome size and invasiveness at the
   intraspecific level. Monoploid genome size was the only significant
   variable that clearly separated the North American native plants from
   those of European origin. The mean Cx value (the amount of DNA in one
   chromosome set) for source European native populations was 0.490 +/-
   0.007 (mean +/- SD), for North American invasive 0.506 +/- 0.020, and
   for North American native 0.543 +/- 0.021. Relative to native
   populations, the European populations that successfully invaded North
   America had a smaller genome that was associated with plant traits
   favoring invasiveness (long rhizomes, early emerging abundant shoots,
   resistance to aphid attack, and low C:N ratio). The knowledge that
   invasive populations within species can be identified based on genome
   size can be applied to screen potentially invasive populations of
   Phragmites in other parts of the world where they could grow in mixed
   stands with native plants, as well as to other plant species with
   intraspecific variation in invasion potential. Moreover, as small
   genomes are better equipped to respond to extreme environmental
   conditions such as drought, the mechanism reported here may represent an
   emerging driver for future invasions and range expansions.}},

  abstract                   = {{1. Mounting evidence shows that the functioning and stability of coastal
   ecosystems often depends critically on habitat-forming foundation
   species such as seagrasses, mangroves and saltmarsh grasses that engage
   in facultative mutualistic interactions. However, although restoration
   science is now gradually expanding its long-standing paradigm of
   minimizing competition to including intraspecific, or within species,
   facilitation in its designs, the potential of harnessing mutualistic
   interactions between species for restoration purposes remains
   uninvestigated.
   2. Here, we experimentally tested whether a previously documented
   mutualism between marsh-forming Spartina alterniflora (cordgrass) and
   Geukensia demissa (mussels) can increase restoration success in degraded
   US saltmarshes.
   3. We found that co-transplanted mussels locally increased nutrients and
   reduced sulphide stress, thereby increasing cordgrass growth and clonal
   expansion by 50\%. We then removed above-ground vegetation and mussels
   to simulate a disturbance event and discovered that cordgrass
   co-transplanted with mussels experienced three times greater survival
   than control transplants.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that mussels
   amplify cordgrass re-colonization and resilience over spatial and
   temporal scales that exceed those of their actual mutualistic
   interaction. By experimentally demonstrating that mutualistic partners
   can enable foundation species to overcome stress barriers to establish
   and persist, we highlight that coastal restoration needs to evolve
   beyond the sole inclusion of intraspecific-positive interactions. In
   particular, we suggest that integrating mutualisms in restoration
   designs may powerfully enhance long-term restoration success and
   ecosystem resilience in the many coastal ecosystems where mutualisms
   involving foundation species are important ecosystem-structuring
   interactions.}},
