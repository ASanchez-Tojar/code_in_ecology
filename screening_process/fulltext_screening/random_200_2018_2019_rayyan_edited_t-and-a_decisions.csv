el_ayari_hidden_2019,The hidden side of a major marine biogeographic boundary: a wide mosaic hybrid zone at the {Atlantic}-{Mediterranean} divide reveals the complex interaction between natural and genetic barriers in mussels,2019,1,1,HEREDITY,0018-067X,122,6,770--784,"El Ayari, Tahani and El Menif, Najoua Trigui and Hamer, Bojan and Cahill, Abigail E. and Bierne, Nicolas month = jun,",10.1038/s41437-018-0174-y,,,,"The Almeria-Oran Front (AOF) is a recognised hotspot of genetic differentiation in the sea, with genetic discontinuities reported in more than 50 species. The AOF is a barrier to dispersal and an ecological boundary; both can determine the position of these genetic breaks. However, the maintenance of genetic differentiation is likely reinforced by genetic barriers. A general drawback of previous studies is an insufficient density of sampling sites at the transition zone, with a conspicuous lack of samples from the southern coastline. We analysed the fine-scale genetic structure in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis using a few ancestry-informative loci previously identified from genome scans. We discovered a 600-km-wide mosaic hybrid zone eastward of the AOF along the Algerian coasts. This mosaic zone provides a new twist to our understanding of the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition because it demonstrates that the two lineages can live in sympatry with ample opportunities to interbreed in a large area, but they hardly do so. This implies that some form of reproductive isolation must exist to maintain the two genetic backgrounds locally cohesive. The mosaic zone ends with an abrupt genetic shift at a barrier to dispersal in the Gulf of Bejaia, Eastern Algeria. Simulations of endogenous or exogenous selection in models that account for the geography and hydrodynamic features of the region support the hypothesis that sister hybrid zones could have been differentially trapped at two alternative barriers to dispersal and/or environmental boundaries, at Almeria in the north and Bejaia in the south. A preponderantly unidirectional north-south gene flow next to the AOF can also maintain a patch of intrinsically maintained genetic background in the south and the mosaic structure, even in the absence of local adaptation. Our results concur with the coupling hypothesis that suggests that natural barriers can explain the position of genetic breaks, while their maintenance depends on genetic barriers."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

A total of 1321 trees, representing 37 full-sib F-1 families from 3 environments in British Columbia, Canada, were used as the training population for (1) EBVs (estimated breeding values) of juvenile height (HTJ) in the F-1 generation predicting genomic EBVs of HTJ of 136 individuals in the F-2 generation, (2) deregressed EBVs of F-1 HTJ predicting deregressed genomic EBVs of F-2 HTJ, (3) F-1 mature height (HT35) predicting HTJ EBVs in F-2, and (4) deregressed F-1 HT35 predicting genomic deregressed HTJ EBVs in F-2. Ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (RRBLUP), generalized ridge regression (GRR), and Bayes-B GS methods were used and compared to pedigree-based (ABLUP) predictions. GS accuracies for scenarios 1 (0.92, 0.91, and 0.91) and 3 (0.57, 0.56, and 0.58) were similar to their ABLUP counterparts (0.92 and 0.60, respectively) (using RR-BLUP, GRR, and Bayes-B). Results using deregressed values fell dramatically for both scenarios 2 and 4 which approached zero in many cases. Cross-generational GS validation of juvenile height in Douglas-fir produced predictive accuracies almost as high as that of ABLUP. Without capturing LD, GS cannot surpass the prediction of ABLUP. Here we tracked pedigree relatedness between training and validation sets. More markers or improved distribution of markers are required to capture LD in Douglas-fir. This is essential for accurate forward selection among siblings as markers that track pedigree are of little use for forward selection of individuals within controlled pollinated families."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Carla and Wigley-Coetsee, Corli and Botha, Judith month = may,",10.1111/1365-2745.13106,,,,"Rainfall variability, including drought, consistently translates into variation in grass productivity in savanna ecosystems. These variations in grass availability can impact grazer populations, which can in turn shape grass responses to drought. However, despite clear evidence that grazers move freely in response to forage and water availability, drought ecologists have mostly failed to consider how these landscape-scale processes influence vegetation responses to drought. Here, we ask how rainfall variability and drought, in interaction with population dynamics and movement of large grazers, shape grass layer responses in extant savanna landscapes in Kruger National Park in South Africa. We found that grass biomass was highly responsive to rainfall variability; notably, grass declines during drought were especially severe-even more severe than previously documented elsewhere. Grazing probably contributed, exacerbating drought effects in droughted regions and spatially extending them into non-droughted refugia, where grass biomass also declined. Moreover, the existence of these refugia potentially prevented a grazer population crash. Synthesis. Our current focus on the physiological effects of drought is probably insufficient for understanding vegetation responses to drought. A renewed focus on landscape processes, including animal movement, will be critical to predicting savanna responses to increasingly frequent extreme events."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Yet, the plant traits underlying these effects, the extended consequences for higher trophic levels (i.e. predators), and the implications for plant growth and reproduction have received little attention. Here, we asked whether simulated early insect leaf damage on wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) affected subsequent damage by insect leaf chewers and pathogenic fungi, as well as ant abundance. To address the mechanisms behind such effects, we measured plant defensive traits induced by early leaf damage to determine which inducible traits might determine the effects on plant-associates. We also evaluated whether early damage influenced plant growth and flower production, and if such effects were mediated by subsequent insect herbivory or pathogen infection. We show that simulated early leaf damage reduced damage by subsequent leaf-chewing insects, increased plant fungal infections, but did not affect ant abundance. Leaf defensive traits (lignins and pubescence) were significantly induced by early damage and were negatively associated with insect herbivory and infection severity, but did not account for the effects of early leaf damage on either of these subsequent attackers. In addition, ant abundance was not associated with (or accounted for) subsequent herbivory or infection, suggesting they did not confer plant protection. Finally, early leaf damage negatively affected plant growth and flower production and analyses suggested that the effect on the latter was, at least partly, mediated by increased fungal infections. Synthesis. Overall, these findings show that early herbivory determines the outcome of cotton interactions with subsequent attackers, and such effects have an impact on plant growth and flower output."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

For ectotherms, this challenge requires methods to scale-up microclimatic information into actual body temperatures, T-b, while dealing with uncertainty regarding individual behaviors and physiological constraints. Here, we propose an information-theoretical model to derive microhabitat selection and T-b distributions of ectotherm populations from microclimatic data. The model infers the most probable allocation of individuals among the available microenvironments and the associated population-level T-b distribution. Using empirical T-b data of 41 species of desert lizards from three independently evolved systems-Western North America, Kalahari Desert, and Western Australia-we show that the model accurately predicts empirical T-b distributions across the three systems. Moreover, the framework naturally provides a way to quantify the importance of thermoregulation in a thermal environment and thereby a measurement for the constraint imposed by the climatic conditions. By predicting T-b distributions of ectotherm populations even without exhaustive information on the underpinning mechanisms, our approach forms a solid theoretical basis for upscaling microclimatic and physiological information into a population-level fitness trait. This scaling process is a first step to reliably project the biological impacts of climate change to broad temporal and spatial scales. Para predecir de manera fiable los impactos bioticos del cambio climatico, es necesario predecir como la eficacia biologica responde a variaciones en las condiciones ambientales. En ectotermos, este reto requiere de metodos que permitan escalar informacion microclimatica a temperaturas corporales reales, T-b, y al mismo tiempo lidiar con la incertidumbre derivada de comportamientos individuales y limitantes fisiologicas. En este trabajo, proponemos un modelo basado en teoria de la informacion que permite calcular la preferencia de microhabitats y distribuciones de T-b de poblaciones de ectotermos a partir de datos microclimaticos. El modelo infiere la distribucion espacial mas probable de los individuos entre los microambientes disponibles y la distribucion de T-b a nivel de poblacion. Utilizando datos empiricos de T-b de 41 especies de lagartos de desierto provenientes de tres sistemas independientes-oeste de Norteamerica, Desierto del Kalahari y oeste de Australia-mostramos que el modelo logra predecir con precision las distribuciones de T-b a traves de los tres sistemas. Ademas de esto, el metodo permite cuantificar la importancia de la termorregulacion en un ambiente termico y con ello, aportar una medida de las restricciones termicas impuestas por las condiciones climaticas.

Within tissue samples, TL varies between cells and chromosomes. Class I telomeres are (presumably static) interstitial telomeric sequences, while terminal telomeres have been divided in shorter (Class II) telomeres and ultralong (Class III) telomeres, and the presence of the latter varies strongly between species. Class II telomeres typically shorten with age, but little is known of Class III telomere dynamics. Using multiple experimental approaches, we show great tits to have ultralong telomeres, and we investigated age effects on Class II and III telomeres using a longitudinal approach (our method excludes Class I telomeres). In adults, TL averaged over the whole distribution did not significantly change with age. However, more detailed analyses showed that Class II TL did shorten with age, and, as in other species, the longest Class II telomeres within individuals shortened more quickly with age. In contrast, Class III TL did not shorten with age within individual adults. Surprisingly, we found the opposite pattern in nestlings: Class III TL shortened significantly with age, while the age effect on Class II TL was close to zero. Thus, Class III TL may provide information on developmental history, while Class II TL provides information on telomere dynamics in adulthood. These findings have practical implications for telomere studies and raise the interesting question of what causes variation in TL dynamics between chromosomes within individuals and how this is related to development."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Whether the phenotypic changes associated with changes in nutrition represent an adaptive response is largely unknown. Further, it is unclear whether the response of fitness components to diet even has the potential to evolve in most systems. In this study, we use an admixed multi-parental population of Drosophila melanogaster reared in three different diet conditions to estimate quantitative genetic parameters for lifespan and fecundity. We find significant genetic variation for both traits in our population and show that lifespan has moderate to high heritabilities within diets. Genetic correlations for lifespan between diets were significantly less than one, demonstrating a strong genotype by diet interaction. These findings demonstrate substantial standing genetic variation in our population that is comparable to natural populations and highlights the potential for adaptation to changing nutritional environments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Sexual conflict frequently leads to behavioural adaptations that allow males to displace their rivals, but in doing so harm those same females they are competing to access, which can decrease population viability and facilitate extinction. We are far from understanding what factors modulate the intensity of sexual conflict and particularly the role of ecology in mediating underlying behavioural adaptations. In this study, we show that, in Drosophila melanogaster, variations in environmental temperature of +/- 4 degrees C decrease male harm impact on female fitness by between 45\% and 73\%. Rate-sensitive fitness estimates indicate that such modulation results in an average rescue of population productivity of 7\% at colder temperatures and 23\% at hotter temperatures. Our results: (a) show that the thermal ecology of social interactions can drastically modulate male harm via behavioural plasticity, (b) identify a potentially crucial ecological factor to understand how sexual conflict operates in nature and (c), along with recent studies, suggest that behaviourally plastic responses can lessen the negative effect of sexual conflict on population viability in the face of rapid environmental temperature changes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

This may allow microbial populations to simultaneously explore multiple evolutionary paths. But how structured a microbial population must be before this effect is realized is not known. We used empirical and simulation studies to explore the relationship between spatial structure and the maintenance of diversity. The degree of spatial structure experienced by Escherichia coli metapopulations was manipulated by varying the migration rate between its component subpopulations. Each subpopulation was inoculated with an equal number of two equally fit genotypes, and their frequencies in 12 subpopulations were determined during 150 generations of evolution. We observed that the frequency of the loser genotypes decreased exponentially as the migration rate between the subpopulations was increased and that higher frequencies of the loser genotypes were maintained in structured metapopulations. These results demonstrate that structured microbial populations can evolve along multiple evolutionary trajectories even when migration rates between the subpopulations are relatively high."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We show how antlions exploit the properties of the substrate to produce very effective structures in the minimum amount of time. Our modelling demonstrates how antlions: (i) exploit self-stratification in granular media differentially to expose deleterious large grains at the bottom of the construction trench where they can be ejected preferentially, and (ii) minimize completion time by spiral rather than central digging. Both phenomena are confirmed by our experiments. Spiral digging saves time because it enables the antlion to eject material initially from the periphery of the pit where it is less likely to topple back into the centre. As a result, antlions can produce their pits-lined almost exclusively with small slippery grains to maximize powerful avalanches and hence prey capture-much more quickly than if they simply dig at the pit's centre. Our demonstration, for the first time to our knowledge, of an animal using self-stratification in granular media exemplifies the sophistication of extended phenotypes even if they are only formed from material found in the animal's environment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We verified this pattern in species richness of ascidians, finding that higher colonial-to-solitary species ratios occur in the tropics and subtropics. At the latitudinal region with the highest ratio, in southeastern Brazil, we confirmed that colonial species dominate space on artificial plates in two independent studies of five fouling communities. We manipulated settlement plates to measure effects of predation and competition on growth and survivorship of colonial versus solitary ascidians. Eight species were subjected to a predation treatment, i.e. caged versus exposed to predators, and a competition treatment, i.e. leaving versus removing competitors, to assess main and interactive effects. Predation had a greater effect on growth and survivorship of colonial compared to solitary species, whereas competition did not show consistent patterns. We hypothesize that colonial ascidians dominate at this subtropical site despite being highly preyed upon because they regrow when partially consumed and can adjust in shape and space to grow into refuges. We contend that these means of avoiding mortality from predation can have large influences on diversification patterns of colonial species at low latitudes, where predation intensity is greater."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Traits of non-native plants may either help them compete or avoid competition with natives, and depending on their interaction with the native community, the non-native may act as more or less of an active driver vs. a passive passenger of change in the native ecosystem. Trait comparisons between native and non-native plants are often laboratory-based, providing insights that can be difficult to apply to natural communities. Studies of the impacts of non-native plants, by contrast, are generally performed in natural communities, but usually do not compare observed impacts of the non-natives with those exerted by dominant natives on each other and the community. Thus, the likely relative disruption of the non-native to the community is unclear. In a four-year observational study conducted at the microhabitat scale in the herbaceous layer of a Midwestern oak forest, we compared the non-native herb Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) with dominant native herbaceous species in terms of correlational patterns related to three broad categories of traits: (1) environmental correlates (light, topography, soil nutrients) with presence and cover, (2) inter-annual regeneration and phenology, and (3) associations with other species (competition and herbivory). We found that Alliaria differed strongly from dominant native herbs in all three categories. Compared with native herbs, Alliaria was more strongly associated with south-facing slopes and high nutrient levels, displayed earlier phenology and enhanced dispersal ability, and was strongly avoided by the generalist native herbivore, Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer). Despite well-described allelopathic effects of Alliaria on mycorrhizae and mycorrhizal plants, we found little evidence to suggest that Alliaria had negative interactions with native plants that were stronger than those of native community members. Overall, our data suggest that naturalization of Alliaria in this site is primarily due to differences from native plants in phenology, dispersal capability, and avoidance of herbivory, and that Alliaria is therefore more likely to be acting as a passenger than as a driver of change in our site."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In this study, we compared homogenization effects of cultivated and spontaneous non-native species in yard floras across and within seven widely distributed U.S. cities. Additionally, we explored which traits explained their particular contribution to homogenization. We recorded plant presence/absence in 178 private yards distributed among seven metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. We compared phylogenetic homogenization effects of non-native species within both the cultivated and spontaneous species pools using phylogenetic dissimilarities and the homogenization index. Then, we expressed contributions of non-native species to the homogenization of each pool as a function of two different sets of plant functional traits using phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) models across and within cities. Across cities, spontaneous non-native species homogenized, and cultivated non-native species differentiated, yard floras. Within the spontaneous pool, short, small-seeded non-native plants and non-native grasses significantly homogenized yard floras. Within the cultivated pool, species contribution to homogenization was best predicted by plant height, presence of showy flowers, and growth form, with non-native grasses significantly homogenizing cultivated yard floras. Within cities, non-native species-whether they were cultivated or spontaneous- consistently homogenized yard floras of the three northern cities and differentiated yard floras of three of the four southern cities, suggesting that homogenization processes are context- and scale-dependent. Likewise, traits explaining homogenization differed substantially among cities. The inconsistent patterns among cities in the plant traits that promoted homogenization of both cultivated and spontaneous species suggest that local environmental and anthropogenic conditions of individual cities imposed strong constraints on trait selection. Linking plant functional traits that promote homogenization with residents' preferences for vegetation may further enhance understanding of how yard plant communities assemble at regional and local scales."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Exposure to warmer temperatures can increase cellular oxidative damage in ectotherms. Yet, it is unknown whether thermal stress during early life has prolonged effects on oxidative status during adulthood. In an experiment using F1 fish originated from a wild three-spined stickleback population at the southern edge of its European distribution, we examined whether experimental thermal conditions experienced in winter had carry-over effects on oxidative status and telomere length, a marker of accumulated stress, in the soma and germline during adulthood. For this, oxidative DNA damage, enzymatic antioxidant activities and telomere length were measured three months after the termination of the temperature manipulation. In addition, we tested whether such delayed effects, if any, were due to individuals' compensatory growth after experiencing unfavourable growth conditions in winter. Warm acclimation during winter induced increased levels of oxidative DNA damage in muscle and sperm and increased enzymatic antioxidant defences in muscle during the breeding season. Telomere length of adult fish was not influenced by thermal conditions experienced during early life. Winter temperature manipulation influenced fish to alter the temporal pattern of growth trajectories across the juvenile and adult stages. Fish reared in warm winter conditions grew at a slower rate than the controls during the period of temperature manipulation then accelerated body mass gain to catch up during the breeding season. Faster somatic growth during the breeding season incurred a higher cost in terms of oxidative damage in the warm-treated individuals. For the first time, we experimentally show the long-lasting detrimental effects of thermal stress on and the positive link between catch-up growth and oxidative DNA damage in the soma and germline. Winter temperature increases due to climate change can reduce fertility and survival of fish by inducing catch-up growth. The detrimental effects of winter climate change may accumulate across generations through the pre-mutagenic DNA damage in the germline."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Substantial releases are also a novel resistance management tool, since wild type alleles conferring susceptibility to pesticides can dilute resistance alleles in target populations. However, a potential barrier is the need for large-scale area-wide releases. Here, we address whether localized releases of transgenic insects could provide an alternative means of population suppression and resistance management, without serious loss of efficacy. We used experimental mesocosms constituting insect metapopulations to explore the evolution of resistance to the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin Cry1Ac in a high-dose/refugia landscape in the insect Plutella xylostella. We ran two selection experiments, the first compared the efficacy of everywhere releases and negative controls to a spatially density-dependent or whack-a-mole strategy that concentrated release of transgenic insects in subpopulations with elevated resistance. The second experiment tested the relative efficacy of whack-a-mole and everywhere releases under spatially homogenous and heterogeneous selection pressure. The whack-a-mole releases were less effective than everywhere releases in terms of slowing the evolution of resistance, which, in the first experiment, largely prevented the evolution of resistance. In contrast to predictions, heterogeneous whack-a-mole releases were no more effective under heterogeneous selection pressure. Heterogeneous selection pressure did, however, reduce total insect population sizes. Whack-a-mole releases provided early population suppression, indistinguishable from homogeneous everywhere releases. However, insect population densities tracked the evolution of resistance in this system, as phenotypic resistance provides access to additional diet containing the toxin Cry1Ac. Thus, as resistance levels diverged between treatments, carrying capacities and population sizes increased under the whack-a-mole approach. Synthesis and applications. Spatially density-dependent releases of transgenic insects, particularly those targeting source populations at a landscape level, could suppress pest populations in the absence of blanket area-wide releases. The benefits of self-limiting transgenic insects were reduced in spatially localized releases, suggesting that they are not ideal for spot treatment of resistance problems. Nevertheless, spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous releases could be used to support other resistance management interventions."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Despite the large extension of restored forests, the success of contrasting restoration strategies (active - planted forests - vs. passive - secondary forests -) over time has never been evaluated in Mediterranean forests. We studied how restoration strategy determined forest restoration success. We evaluated which restoration strategy resulted in forests more like references (i.e. forests with continuous canopy cover since at least the 1940s) in terms of structure, diversity, functional composition, and dynamics. We then assessed whether active restoration accelerated forest recovery compared to passive restoration. We studied a chronosequence of recovery in four forest types (mountain and Mediterranean pine forests and mesic and Mediterranean oak forests) using the data of the Spanish Forest Inventory in central Spain. Each plot was classified as planted, secondary or reference forest. We modelled the response ratios of 11 forest attributes and a multifunctionality index as a function of restoration strategy, forest age, and abiotic and biotic constraints. Secondary forests showed a greater likeness to references than planted forests in oak forests while minor differences between secondary and planted forests were found in pine forests. The recovery speed of most forest attributes in secondary and planted forests was similar. Multifunctionality was higher, and increased more rapidly, in planted than in secondary forests in Mediterranean oak forests. However, multifunctionality was similar for both restoration strategies in the other forest types. Synthesis and applications. The long-term assessment of forest recovery in Mediterranean abandoned fields indicated that both planted forests and natural forest succession are successful restoration strategies, depending on the aim and the forest type. In our research, restoration strategy did not influence the magnitude and speed of forest recovery in pine forests. However, in oak forests, natural forest succession led to forests more alike to references, but planted forests can maximize and accelerate recovery of forest multifunctionality."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Having a method that could rapidly determine which of the many available run metrics are the most important indicators of overall run quality and having a way to monitor these during a given sequencing run would be extremely helpful to this effect. Therefore, we compared various run metrics across 486 MiSeq runs, from five different machines. By performing a statistical analysis using principal components analysis and a K-means clustering algorithm of the metrics, we were able to validate metric comparisons among instruments, allowing for the development of a predictive algorithm, which permits one to observe whether a given MiSeq run has performed adequately. This algorithm is available in an Excel spreadsheet: that is, MiSeq Instrument \& Run (In-Run) Forecast. Our tool can help verify that the quantity/quality of the generated sequencing data consistently meets or exceeds recommended manufacturer expectations.

Age is strongly related to individual physiological condition, reproductive potential and mortality rate. Currently, there are no robust molecular methods for age estimation in birds. Instead, individuals must be ringed as chicks to establish known-age populations, which is a labour-intensive and expensive process. The estimation of chronological age using DNA methylation (DNAm) is emerging as a robust approach in mammals including humans, mice and some non-model species. Here, we quantified DNAm in whole blood samples from a total of 71 known-age Short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris) using digital restriction enzyme analysis of methylation (DREAM). The DREAM method measures DNAm levels at thousands of CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome. We identified seven CpG sites with DNAm levels that correlated with age. A model based on these relationships estimated age with a mean difference of 2.8 years to known age, based on validation estimates from models created by repeated sampling of training and validation data subsets. Longitudinal observation of individuals re-sampled over 1 or 2 years generally showed an increase in estimated age (6/7 cases). For the first time, we have shown that epigenetic changes with age can be detected in a wild bird. This approach should be of broad interest to researchers studying age biomarkers in non-model species and will allow identification of markers that can be assessed using targeted techniques for accurate age estimation in large population studies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

The difficulty of obtaining data on functional outcomes has resulted in limited understanding of functional variation among a network's pairwise species interactions, of the study designs that are necessary to capture major sources of functional variation, and of predictors of functional variation that may allow generalization across networks. In this community-scale study, we targeted a key functional outcome in plant-frugivore networks: the impact of frugivore gut passage on seed germination. We used captive frugivore feeding trials and germination experiments in an island ecosystem, attaining species-level coverage across all extant native frugivores and the plants they consume to (a) assess sources of functional variation, (b) separate effects of pulp removal from those of scarification via gut passage, and (c) test trait-based correlates of gut passage effect sizes. We found antagonistic seed predation effects of a frugivore previously assumed to be a seed disperser, highlighting the need to consider functional outcomes rather than interaction frequency alone. The other frugivores each exhibited similar impacts for individual plant species, with benefits primarily caused by pulp removal rather than scarification, supporting the use of animal functional groups in this context. In contrast, plant species varied widely in impacts of gut passage on germination. Species with smaller seeds and more frugivore partners had larger benefits of gut passage, showing promise for network metrics and functional traits to predict functional variation among plants. Synthesis. Combining network and demographic approaches, we assessed the degree and sources of variation in a key functional outcome of plant-frugivore interactions across an entire network. Using a detailed study design, our work shows how simpler study designs can capture primary sources of functional variation and that functional traits and network metrics may allow generalization across networks. Efficiently measuring and generalizing sources of functional variation within mutualistic networks will strengthen our ability to model network dynamics and predict mutualist responses to global change."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Using functional trait and tree demography data from the Luquillo subtropical forest in Puerto Rico, we compared fixed-neighbourhood models with a canopy overlap model, in which tree crown overlap is used as an indicator of neighbourhood crowding. Analyses that combine functional trait and demographic data provide a mechanistic understanding of observed patterns of community structure and dynamics as they provide insights into the linkages between phenotypes and the environment. Overall, canopy overlap models had better support when compared to neighbourhood models using a fixed radius, suggesting that the fixed radius approach does not capture the full extent of competitive interactions among trees. Moreover, the effects of functional neighbourhood on tree survival and growth differ depending on the type of approach used and lead to different conclusions with respect to the drivers of tree community dynamics. Synthesis. In summary, our findings highlight the utility of neighbourhood models based on tree crown overlap, and suggest that applying this same approach to different plots and forests will facilitate comparisons across systems and improve our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the structure and dynamics of tree communities."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Males of O. aureus (Oa) and females of O. niloticus (On) produce all-male offspring, but there is a behavioral reproductive barrier between the two species that prevents mass production. In crosses between Oa and On broodstocks, few hybrid females are attracted to the Oa male nests (denoted responders), and if they harbor the On alleles for the sex determination (SD) sites on linkage groups (LGs) 1, 3, and 23, all-male progeny are produced. Yet, without controlling for the alleles underlying SD, the parental stocks gradually lose their capability for all-male production. Hypothesizing that marker-assisted selection for female responders would allow production of sustainable broodstocks, we applied genotyping-by-sequencing to generate 4983 informative SNPs from 13 responding and 28 non-responding females from two full-sib families. Accounting for multiple comparisons in a genome-wide association study, seven SNPs met a false discovery rate of 0.061. Lowest nominal probabilities were on LGs 9 and 14, for which microsatellite DNA markers were designed within the candidate genes PTGDSL and CASRL, respectively. By increasing the sample size to 22 responders and 47 non-responders and by genotyping additional established microsatellites, we confirmed the association of these LGs with female responsiveness. The combined effects of microsatellites GM171 and CARSL-LOC100690618 on LGs 9 and 14 explained 37\% of the phenotypic variance of reproductive interaction (p {\textless} 0.0001).

Previous studies on transgenerational effects in Drosophila melanogaster suggest that parental nutrition may affect the body size, developmental duration and egg size of the next generation. However, it is unknown whether these effects on phenotype remain stable across generations, or if specific generations have general responses to ancestral diet. In the current study, we examined the effect on multiple life-history phenotypes of changing diet quality across three generations. Our analysis revealed unforeseen patterns in how phenotypes respond to dietary restriction. Our generalized linear model showed that when considering only two generations, offspring phenotypes were primarily affected by their own diet, and to a lesser extent by the diet of their parents or the interaction between the two generations. Surprisingly, however, when considering three generations, offspring phenotypes were primarily impacted by their grandparents' diet and their own diet. Interactions among different generations' diets affected development time, egg volume and pupal mass more than ovariole number or wing length. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons of diet groups from the same generation revealed commonalities in strong responses to rich versus poor diet: ovariole number, pupal mass and wing length responded more strongly to poor diet than to rich diet, while development time responded strongly to both rich and poor diets. To improve investigations into the mechanisms and consequences of transgenerational, epigenetic inheritance, future studies should closely examine how phenotypes change across a higher number of generations, and consider responses to broader variability in diet treatments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We investigated independent and interactive effects of warming and acidification on a large brown seaweed, the kelp Ecklonia radiata, and its associated microbiome in experimental mesocosms. Microbial communities were affected by warming and, during the first week, by acidification. During the second week, kelp developed disease-like symptoms previously observed in the field. The tissue of some kelp blistered, bleached and eventually degraded, particularly under the acidification treatments, affecting photosynthetic efficiency. Microbial communities differed between blistered and healthy kelp for all treatments, except for those under future conditions of warming and acidification, which after two weeks resembled assemblages associated with healthy hosts. This indicates that changes in the microbiome were not easily predictable as the severity of future climate scenarios increased.

We investigated this potential side-effect of mitigating the TransCanada Highway, which was completed in sections between 1983 and 2013, on the rate of wildlife mortality on the nearby transcontinental mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Banff National Park. For each transportation class (highway and railway), we calculated collision rate as the number of collisions per year and km for two guilds (carnivores and ungulates) before and after mitigation occurred between 1981 and 2014. We constructed additional models for each transportation class and each of four species groups with adequate sample sizes: elk (Cerous canadensis), other ungulates (family Cervidae), bears (Ursus spp.), and coyotes (Canis latrans). Across guilds, mortality rates declined after mitigation, particularly on the highway (as expected) and most strongly for ungulates. For individual species groups, mortality on the railway for elk was best predicted by year and population size, without the inclusion of mitigation status on the adjacent highway. However, collision rates on the railway increased after mitigation for other ungulates (mostly deer, Odocoileus spp.) while also increasing over time. Collision rates on the railway increased over time for bears, but not in relation to highway mitigation. We found no evidence that the spatial distribution of collisions on the railway changed after highway mitigation, as might be expected from a funneling effect of crossing structures. Our results support and extend previous work demonstrating that exclusion fencing and wildlife crossing structures reduce wildlife mortalities on the highway at this location, and provide limited evidence, for other ungulates alone, that such mitigation may increase mortality on the adjacent railway. Similar analyses are warranted in other locations, particularly mountainous regions, where major transportation features often occur in close proximity."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Boosted regression tree analysis predicted brook trout occurrence at the stream reach scale with a high degree of accuracy (CV AUC = 0.92) as a function of both natural (e.g., water temperature and precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., agriculture and urban development) landscape and climatic attributes. Current land use activities result in a predicted loss of occurrence in over 11,000 stream segments (40\% of suitable habitat) and account for over 15,000 km (45\% of current value) of lost functional brook trout fishery value (i.e., length-weighted occurrence probability) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Climate change (increased ambient temperatures and altered precipitation) is projected to result in a loss of occurrence in at least 3000 additional segments (19\% of current value) and at least 3000 km of functional fishery value (9\% of current value) by 2062. Model outcomes were used to identify low- and high-quality stream segments within relatively intact and degraded sub-watersheds as restoration and protection priorities, respectively, and conservation priorities were targeted in watersheds with high projected resilience to climate change. Our results suggest that traditional restoration activities, such as habitat enhancement, riparian management, and barrier removal, may be able to recover a substantial amount of brook trout habitat lost to historic landscape change.

Here, we present a relative wetland vulnerabilities framework, applicable across a range of spatial and temporal scales, to assist in identifying effective and robust management strategies in light of climate change. We deconstruct vulnerability into dimensions of exposure and sensitivity/adaptive capacity, and identify relevant measures of these as they pertain to the attributes of wetland extent and plant community composition. As a test of the framework, we populate it with data for three primary hydrogeomorphic wetland types (riverine, slope, and depression) in seven small watersheds across four ecoregions (Ridge and Valley, Piedmont, Unglaciated Plateau, and Glaciated Plateau) in the Susquehanna River watershed in Pennsylvania. We use data generated from the SRES A2 emissions experiment and MRI-CGCM2.3.2 dimate model as input to the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model to simulate future exposure to altered hydrologic conditions in our seven watersheds, as expressed in two hydrologic metrics: \% time groundwater levels occur in the upper 30 cm (rooting zone) during the growing season, and median difference between spring and summer mean water levels. We then examine the spatial and temporal scales at which each of the components of vulnerability (exposure and sensitivity/adaptive capacity) shows significant relative differences. Overall, we find that relative differences in exposure persist at a very fine spatial grain, exhibiting high variability even among individual watersheds in a given ecoregion. For temporal scale, we find strong seasonal but weak annual relative differences in exposure resulting from a magnification of summer dry-down combined with winter and spring wet periods becoming wetter. Sensitivities/adaptive capacities show significant differences among wetland types. A comparison between our anticipated hydrologic alterations under dimate change and historical changes in hydrology due to anthropogenic disturbance indicates potential shifts in hydrologic patterns that are far beyond anything that wetland managers have experienced in the past."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Multilayer networks in community ecology will allow space, time and multiple interaction types to be incorporated into species interaction networks. While the multilayer network framework is applicable to ecological questions, it is one thing to be able to describe ecological communities as multilayer networks and another for multilayer networks to actually prove useful for answering ecological questions. Importantly, documenting multilayer network structure requires substantially greater empirical investment than standard ecological networks. In response, we argue that this additional effort is worthwhile and describe a series of research lines where we expect multilayer networks will generate the greatest impact. Inter-layer edges are the key component that differentiate multilayer networks from standard ecological networks. Inter-layer edges join different networkstermed layerstogether and represent ecological processes central to the species interactions studied (e.g., inter-layer edges representing movement for networks separated in space). Inter-layer edges may take a variety of forms, be species- or network-specific, and be measured with a large suite of empirical techniques. Additionally, the sheer size of ecological multilayer networks also requires some changes to empirical data collection around interaction quantification, collaborative efforts and collation in public databases. Network ecology has already touched on a wide swath of ecology and evolutionary biology. Because network stability and patterns of species linkage are the most developed areas of network ecology, they are a natural starting place for multilayer investigations. However, multilayer networks will also provide novel insights to niche partitioning, the connection between traits and species' interactions, and even the geographic mosaic of co-evolution.Synthesis. Multilayer networks provide a formal way to bring together the study of species interaction networks and the processes that influence them. However, describing inter-layer edges and the increasing amounts of data required represent challenges. The pay-off for added investment will be ecological networks that describe the composition and capture the dynamics of ecological communities more completely and, consequently, have greater power for understanding the patterns and processes that underpin diversity in ecological communities."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review"

Feather-clipped parents did not increase work rate but sired larger, and sometimes heavier, nestlings while maintaining lower body temperature and losing less body mass than controls. Thus, when relieved of the demands to dissipate metabolic heat, parents could invest more into both current (nestling condition) and future (self-maintenance) reproduction.

The ecological relevance of differences in tissue isotopes within and between individuals in the context of foraging however depends on understanding tissue turnover times and carbon (Delta C-13) and nitrogen (Delta N-15) discrimination, which can vary with physiology, metabolism, and diet quality. Here, we examine isotope dynamics in captive R. typus as a basis for enhanced ecological insights into wild populations of the world's largest fish and other enigmatic species. A variable diet, principally consisting of two krill (Euphausia pacifica and Euphausia superba) provided an average of 48 +/- 20 MJ/d (mean +/- SD), or 2.7 +/- 1.3 times basal metabolic requirements. On this diet, in agreement with allometric relationships, large body sizes (3,000-4,000 kg) were matched by slow plasma and cartilage turnover rates (empirically derived as 9 months and 3 yr, respectively), which provide tissue-specific limits on the timescales over which we can isotopically detect diet changes in this species. Average diet-to-tissue discrimination showed significant variation between tissues (plasma and cartilage), and among growing and fasting individuals (Delta C-13 range, 1.5 to 5.5 parts per thousand; Delta N-15 range, -0.1 to 2.9 parts per thousand). Assimilation rates increased with temperature and were higher for the smaller E. pacifica (15 +/- 2 mm) than E. superba (48 +/- 2 mm). Growth significantly lowered both Delta N-15(plasma) and Delta N-15(cartilage), with inappetence markedly reducing Delta N-15(plasma) and Delta C-13(plasma), as well as significantly altering blood biochemistry. Captive findings facilitated the first robust multi-tissue growth- and nutrition-corrected isotope analysis of a wild R. typus population, suggesting individual foraging specialization on low trophic level mid-ocean or coastal prey. Long-term fasting during ocean-basin-scale migrations may be common and such metabolic effects should be carefully quantified when isotopically assessing intra-species foraging differences. The metabolically constrained multi-tissue, multi-isotope approach described can facilitate ecological insights that are indispensable for effective conservation and management of globally threatened, but poorly understood, species by identifying differences in key foraging areas and target prey within and between individuals."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Performance of their colonies depends on pollen and nectar as food resources, but flowering plants are scarce in modern agricultural landscapes. It is well-known that semi-natural habitats can enhance floral resources and bumblebee abundance, but the impact of different crop types and their heterogeneity at the landscape scale remains unclear. We tested the effect of two different crop types (oilseed rape [OSR] and maize) and of configurational (field border density) and compositional heterogeneity (crop diversity) on weight gain of buff-tailed bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris) and the pollen diversity collected by them in 20 landscapes in Central Germany. We found that augmenting maize cover had a detrimental effect on pollen diversity collected by bumblebees, probably due to intensive management resulting in low plant diversity. This low pollen diversity translated into reduced colony growth, since colonies with high pollen diversity gained more weight than colonies with low pollen diversity. In contrast, OSR cover and configurational and compositional heterogeneity did neither affect colony growth nor pollen diversity. However, for OSR, the timing of the flowering period was important. When OSR fields had a high flower cover at the end of the OSR blooming period, colonies showed increased growth rates. Synthesis and applications. Our results complement previous laboratory studies by showing that high pollen diversity leads to better colony performance under field conditions. Therefore, the maintenance of floral diversity in agricultural landscapes is crucial to ensure that bumblebees can fulfil their nutritional needs. However, the heterogeneity of crops, at least under the currently very low levels of crop rotation, does not contribute to this aim. In contrast, crop identity and timing of mass-flowering crops turned out to be important factors, as maize reduced pollen resources, while late blooming oilseed rape (OSR) was beneficial to bumblebee colonies. Hence, maize cover per landscape should be reduced and strategies to enhance landscape wide flower diversity, especially towards and after the end of oilseed rape bloom, should be promoted to support bumblebee colonies that provide important pollination services."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the structural complexity of habitats, leading to homogenization. High abundances of common, generalist species in disturbed habitats may be driven by reduced competition from specialists in similar habitats. We quantified habitat availability for and utilization of three co-occurring arboreal geckos (Australian native house geckos [Gehyra dubia], northern velvet geckos [Oedura castelnaui] and eastern spiny-tailed geckos [Strophurus williamsi]) in four replicated grazing regimes in an experimental grazing trial in north-east Queensland, Australia. Native house geckos were most abundant in heavily grazed habitats, whereas the two other species rarely co-occurred (either with each other or with native house geckos). Geckos displayed resource partitioning of habitat features, such as tree species and structural characteristics. We found evidence of interspecific competition among gecko species, in which native house geckos shifted their habitat selection in the presence of velvet geckos. In the absence of other geckos, native house geckos preferred rough, peeling bark and dead trees, yet in the presence of velvet geckos, native house geckos shifted away from dead trees, and used more structurally complex trees, probably due to high niche overlap with velvet geckos. Native house geckos were more resistant to the negative effects of livestock grazing than either velvet or spiny-tailed geckos. In the absence of other species, native house geckos used a wider range of microhabitats. Synthesis and applications. Species assemblages are often the results of multiple or complex factors, including predation pressure, habitat availability or competitive interactions. The homogenizing effects on habitat structure caused by livestock grazing reduce diversity and suitability for microhabitat specialists. Reduced competition can therefore promote the abundance of microhabitat generalist species, such as Australian native house geckos, suggesting that livestock grazing leads to homogenization and simplification of habitat structure, which ultimately leads to changes in species composition through reduced competition. Understanding species' responses to disturbance, and more broadly, habitat complexity, is crucial for maintaining or increasing biological diversity in anthropogenically modified landscapes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

To be sustainable, this production should protect environmental quality and biodiversity. Fertilized mixed-species prairie can deliver substantial quantities of cellulosic ethanol per unit land area with minimal losses of NO3-N in drainage water, but the long-term maintenance of biodiversity in such systems has been uncertain. We report how nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer application, precipitation, and time affected the species composition and productivity of reconstructed prairie communities harvested annually as biofuel feedstocks over a 9-year period. Results indicated that both precipitation and fertilizer application drove above-ground biomass production, with the greatest response to fertilizer occurring in wetter than average years. Fertilization reduced species richness, but increased species evenness. Consequently, Simpson's diversity index did not differ between the fertilized and unfertilized communities, though it declined in both communities over time. A total of 59 plant species was recorded, with eight of them explaining most of the differences in vegetation cover between the fertilized and unfertilized treatments. After 9 years, the high fertility community was dominated by the C4 grass Andropogon gerardii, the C3 grass Elymus canadensis, and the non-leguminous forbs Heliopsis helianthoides, Helianthus maximiliani, and Monarda fistulosa, whereas the low fertility community was dominated by the C4 grasses A. gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, the C3 grass E. canadensis, and the non-leguminous forb M. fistulosa. Fertilization increased the abundance of flowering forbs available to pollinators in the early, middle and late portions of the growing season. Synthesis and applications. Results of our study suggest that maintenance of reasonably high levels of productivity and biodiversity are possible in fertilized prairie communities harvested annually for bioenergy, with plant cover more evenly distributed among different functional groups. In the future, if policy and markets favour biofuels and better delivery of ecosystem services from harvested land, prairie-based feedstocks could become part of a renewable energy portfolio that fosters biodiversity and contributes to the provision of floral resources for pollinators."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

While static approaches to spatial management rely on one-time assessments of biological, environmental, economic, and/or social conditions, dynamic approaches repeatedly assess conditions to produce regularly updated management recommendations. Owing to this complexity, particularly regarding operational challenges, examples of applied DM are rare. To implement DM, scientific methodologies are operationalized into tools, i.e., self-contained workflows that run automatically at a prescribed temporal frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). Here we present a start-to-finish framework for operationalizing DM tools, consisting of four stages: Acquisition, Prediction, Dissemination, and Automation. We illustrate this operationalization framework using an applied DM tool as a case study. Our DM tool operates in near real-time and was designed to maximize target catch and minimize bycatch of non-target and protected species in a US-based commercial fishery. It is important to quantify the sensitivity of DM tools to missing data, because dissemination streams for observed (i.e., remotely sensed or directly sampled) data can experience delays or gaps. To address this issue, we perform a detailed example sensitivity analysis using our case study tool. Synthesis and applications. Dynamic management (DM) tools are emerging as viable management solutions to accommodate the biological, environmental, economic, and social variability in our fundamentally dynamic world. Our four-stage operationalization framework and case study can facilitate the implementation of DM tools for a wide array of resource and disturbance management objectives."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Owing to climate change and increasing ungulate numbers, the abiotic and biotic environments of trees are changing remarkably, making it necessary to investigate the separate and joint effects of seed source (i.e., location of tree population origin) and ungulate herbivory. We used a common garden experiment to study the growth and morphology of Fagus sylvatica saplings from 77 Swiss seed sources. The experiment was set up at two sites and included a clipping treatment (i.e., terminal shoot clipped at two intensities) applied before budburst to simulate winter ungulate browsing. We studied F. sylvatica sapling growth and morphology before and two years after clipping. Measured growth traits included sapling height, stem diameter, and biomass. Morphological traits included multi-stemming, stem and crown form, stem quality, and reaction to clipping. Seed source, test site, and simulated leader browsing were all important in determining the growth and quality of F. sylvatica saplings. The effects of seed source on growth and quality indicate that F. sylvatica possesses a large pool of diverse genotypes across Switzerland and thus has the potential to adapt to local conditions through gene flow. Growth and morphology differed significantly between the two test sites, indicating that local environments should be considered carefully when a new plantation is established. The effect of the single simulated browsing event disappeared over time for the growth traits, owing to growth compensation. However, sapling quality decreased after clipping, suggesting that browsing may lead to persistent quality losses in production forests. Neither the growth nor the morphological reaction after clipping depended on the effect of population, meaning that resilience to browsing was independent of seed source. Consequently, interactions with ungulate browsing do not have to be taken into account when selecting F. sylvatica populations for particular climatic and site conditions."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

While this pattern has been investigated for a wide range of organisms, ecosystems and geographical gradients, whether these changes vary more cryptically across different forest strata (from ground to canopy) remains elusive. Here, we investigated the influence of ground vs. arboreal assemblages to the general distance-decay relationship observed in forests. We seek to explain differences in distance-decay relationships between strata in the context of the vertical stratification of assemblage composition, richness and abundance. We surveyed for a climate-sensitive model organism, amphibians, across vertical rainforest strata in Madagascar. For each tree, we defined assemblages of ground-dwelling, understory, or canopy species. We calculated horizontal distance-decay in similarity across all trees, and across assemblages of species found in different forest strata (ground, understory and canopy). We demonstrate that within stratum comparisons exhibit a classic distance-decay relationship for canopy and understory communities but no distance-decay relationships for ground communities. We suggest that differences in horizontal turnover between strata may be due to local scale habitat and resource heterogeneity in the canopy, or the influence of arboreal traits on species dispersal and distribution. Synthesis. Biodiversity patterns in horizontal space were not consistent across vertical space, suggesting that canopy fauna may not play by the same set of rules as their conspecifics living below them on the ground. Our study provides compelling evidence that the above-ground amphibian assemblage of tropical rainforests is the primary driver of the classical distance-decay relationship."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Meanwhile, emerging global agendas are providing unprecedented incentives for large-scale restoration within human-impacted tropical forest landscapes. Whilst logged forests have high conservation value, their adoption within these agendas remains controversial. We review the value of restoring logged tropical forests for boosting economic and environmental resilience. Targeted interventions can recover depleted timber stocks, increase saleable carbon stores, and deliver employment and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to local communities. Restoration has mixed outcomes for biodiversity but if it improves relogging practices and protects forests from conversion to agricultural plantations may have major positive impacts. We also examine socio-economic and political pathways for upscaling logged forest restoration and their incorporation into sustainable forestry, given political and commercial malaise on post-logging interventions. Spurring these transitions will require strong institutions, executed by policies that enable long-term concession licences and community land tenure, that leverage commercial involvement and payments for ecosystem services, and that optimise existing interventions. Research frontiers include: (a) validating the economic and technical feasibility of different interventions; (b) understanding how these interventions impact on synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services, NTFPs, and biodiversity; and (c) identifying when to restore a logged forest. This requires establishing long-term experimental trials that jointly track environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. Synthesis and applications. Post-logging interventions can deliver various timber, carbon, socioeconomic and potentially biodiversity benefits but are underemployed and undervalued pantropically. Opportunities exist to optimise interventions by tailoring incentives, policies, and management to ecological and social circumstances. Governments, conservation bodies and the private sector must underscore restoration of production forests as a major future objective, including via greater adoption in global initiatives, including forest and landscape restoration under the Bonn Challenge and the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) agenda."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review"

Reducing these effects requires mitigation, including wildlife crossing structures and fencing. However, mitigation measures are expensive and vary in their success level, especially when constructed to meet the needs of several species. Moreover, mitigation planning rarely considers the needs of multiple species. As funds are limited, deciding where and how to act for the greatest return on investment is crucial. Combining decision theory with a metapopulation model, we determined the most cost-effective actions mitigating the effects of roads on multiple species. The model is illustrated with two sets of species with varying of life-history traits, from a diversity of taxonomic groups. We tested the cost-effectiveness of spatially explicit combinations of three management options for each road section: (a) no mitigation, (b) fences without wildlife crossings, and (c) fences combined with wildlife crossings. We explored the trade-offs between each population's probability of persistence and total mitigation cost, first on a per-species basis and then considering all species. We then tested the cost-effectiveness of different planning strategies: (a) single species, (b) two types of focal species based on different life-history traits, and (c) comprehensive multispecies planning. Planning for the needs of all species at the same time (multispecies strategy) maximizes the number of persisting species and provides the most robust and cost-effective planning strategy, while single-species strategies were found to be inefficient. However, basing decisions on the focal species with the largest home range can provide reasonably cost-effective results, but should be considered only when there is not enough time or money to collect the necessary information to perform a multispecies analysis. Synthesis and applications. Our model can be adapted to most road mitigation problems. It illustrates that the needs of multiple species should be considered to plan a cost-effective road mitigation system. However, when resources are limited to plan for all species, those with larger home ranges should be used as reasonable proxies for other species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We hypothesized that more favorable climates and higher levels of herbivory would lead to increases in growth and defense across plant populations. We evaluated whether plant growth and defense traits covaried across 18 populations of showy milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) inhabiting an east-west climate gradient spanning 25 degrees of longitude. A suite of traits impacting defense (e.g., latex, cardenolides), growth (e.g., size), or both (e.g., specific leaf area [SLA], trichomes) were measured in natural populations and in a common garden, allowing us to evaluate plastic and genetically based variation in these traits. In natural populations, herbivore pressure increased toward warmer sites with longer growing seasons. Growth and defense traits showed strong clinal patterns and were positively correlated. In a common garden, clines with climatic origin were recapitulated only for defense traits. Correlations between growth and defense traits were also weaker and more negative in the common garden than in the natural populations. Thus, our data suggest that climatically favorable sites likely facilitate the evolution of greater defense at minimal costs to growth, likely because of increased resource acquisition."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Here we assess the extent of sexual dimorphism in four risk-taking behaviour traits in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, and apply a multivariate approach to test for GxS interactions. We also quantify the among-individual and genetic covariances between personality and size and growth, which are known a priori to differ between the sexes. We found significant sexual dimorphism in three of the four behaviours, although r(mf) between sex-specific homologous traits was significantly {\textless}+1 for only one behaviour. Using multivariate models, we then estimated sex-specific genetic (co)variance matrices (G(m) and G(f)) and tested for asymmetry of the cross-trait cross-sex genetic covariance structure (submatrix B). While G(m) and G(f) were not significantly different from each other overall, their respective leading eigenvectors were poorly aligned. Statistical support for asymmetry in B was found, but limited to a single trait pair for which the cross-sex covariances differed (i.e., COVA(m,f) not equal COVA(f,m)). Thus, while single- and multi-trait perspectives evidence some GxS, the overall picture is one of similarity between the sexes in their genetic (co)variance structures.

Controlled self- and cross-pollinations confirmed that P. oreodoxa unlike most heterostylous species is fully self-compatible. Segregation patterns indicated that the inheritance of distyly is governed by a single Mendelian locus with the short-styled morph carrying at least one dominant S-allele (S-) and long-styled plants homozygous recessive (ss). Crossing data were consistent with a model in which homostyly results from genetic changes at the distylous linkage group, with the homostylous allele (S-h) dominant to the long-styled allele (s), but recessive to the short-styled allele (S). Progeny tests of open-pollinated seed families revealed high rates of intermorph mating in the L-morph but considerable selfing and possibly intramorph mating in the S-morph and in homostyles. S-morph plants homozygous at the S-locus (SS) occurred in several populations but may experience viability selection. The crossing data from distylous and homostylous plants are consistent with either recombination at the S-locus governing distyly, or mutation at gene(s) controlling sex-organ height; both models predict the same patterns of segregation. Recent studies on the molecular genetics of distyly in Primula demonstrating the hemizygous nature of genes at the S-locus make it more likely that homostyles have resulted from mutation rather than recombination."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We found that this resulted in topologies that are highly congruent with the current consensus phylogeny, at least when the predicted ancestors are assumed to be well preserved and densely sampled. Most strikingly, several analyses recovered the monophyly of clades that have never been found in previous morphology-only studies, such as Afrotheria and Laurasiatheria.

Via growth-curve analysis, we demonstrate that self-reported empathy (as measured by the empathy quotient-EQ) predicts the temporal evolution of gaze behaviour under conditions where social and non-social stimuli compete for attention. In both datasets, we found that EQ not only predicted a global increase in social attention, but predicted a different temporal profile of social attention. Specifically, we detected a reliable effect of empathy on gaze towards social images after prolonged viewing. An analysis of switch latencies revealed that low-EQ observers switched gaze away from an initially fixated social image more frequently and at earlier latencies than high-EQ observers.

A key trait underlying fitness is the shift from vegetative to reproductive growth through floral development. In this study, we used a common garden experiment and genotyping-by-sequencing to test whether the latitudinal flowering cline of the North American invasive plant Medicago polymorpha was translocated from its European native range through multiple introductions, or whether the cline rapidly established due to evolution following a genetic bottleneck. Analysis of flowering time in 736 common garden plants showed a latitudinal flowering time cline in both the native and invaded ranges where genotypes from lower latitudes flowered earlier. Genotyping-by-sequencing of 9,658 SNPs in 446 individuals revealed two major subpopulations of M. polymorpha in the native range, only one of which is present in the invaded range. Additionally, native range populations have higher genetic diversity than invaded range populations, suggesting that a genetic bottleneck occurred during invasion. All invaded range individuals are closely related to plants collected from native range populations in Portugal and southern Spain, and population assignment tests assigned invaded range individuals to this same narrow source region. Taken together, our results suggest that latitudinal clinal variation in flowering time has rapidly evolved across the invaded range despite a genetic bottleneck following introduction."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"
endler_boundary_2018,Boundary strength analysis: {Combining} colour pattern geometry and coloured patch visual properties for use in predicting behaviour and fitness,2018,1,1,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2041-210X,9,12,2334--2348,"Endler, John A. and Cole, Gemma L. and Kranz, Alex and rea M. month = dec,",10.1111/2041-210X.13073,,,,"Colour patterns are used by many species to make decisions that ultimately affect their Darwinian fitness. Colour patterns consist of a mosaic of patches that differ in geometry and visual properties. Although traditionally pattern geometry and colour patch visual properties are analysed separately, these components are likely to work together as a functional unit. Despite this, the combined effect of patch visual properties, patch geometry, and the effects of the patch boundaries on animal visual systems, behaviour and fitness are relatively unexplored. Here, we describe boundary strength analysis (BSA), a novel way to combine the geometry of the edges (boundaries among the patch classes) with the receptor noise estimate (Delta S) of the intensity of the edges. The method is based upon known properties of vertebrate and invertebrate retinas. The mean and SD of Delta S (m(Delta S), s(Delta S)) of a colour pattern can be obtained by weighting each edge class Delta S by its length, separately for chromatic and achromatic Delta S. This assumes those colour patterns, or parts of the patterns used in signalling, with larger m(Delta S) and s(Delta S), are more stimulating and hence more salient to the viewers. BSA can be used to examine both colour patterns and visual backgrounds. Boundary strength analysis was successful in assessing the estimated conspicuousness of colour pattern variants in two species, guppies Poecilia reticulata and Gouldian finches Erythrura gouldiae, both polymorphic for patch colour, luminance and geometry. The 3D representations of the Delta S of patch edges (Fort Diagrams) of both species show that there is little or negative geometric correspondence between the chromatic and achromatic edges. All individuals have m(Delta S) {\textgreater} 1.5 for both chromatic and achromatic measures, indicating the high within-pattern contrast expected for display signals. In contrast from what one would expect from sexual selection, all guppies have m(Delta S) less than expected from random contacts between all pairs of patch colour/luminance classes. The correlation between chromatic and luminance Delta S is negative in both species but zero when correlating all possible kinds of edges between the colours of each species and morph, indicating nonrandom colour geometry. The pattern difference between chromatic and achromatic edges in both species reveals the possibility that chromatic and achromatic edges could function differently. The smaller than random expected m(Delta S) values in guppies suggests an anti-predator function because guppies are never found without predators. Moreover, m(Delta S) could vary with predation intensity within and among species. BSA can be applied to any colour pattern used in intraspecific and interspecific behaviour. Seven predictions and four questions about colour patterns are presented. In species which are very convex in cross-section, both chromatic and luminance m(Delta S) change with viewing angle; geometry of signalling is as important as signal geometry."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

At the same time, there has been an increasing recognition that population structure can generate genetic data similar to those produced under models of population size change. Recently, Mazet et al. (Heredity 116:362-371, 2016) showed that, for any model of population structure, it is always possible to find a panmictic model with a particular function of population size changes, having exactly the same distribution of T2 (the coalescence time for a sample of size two) as that of the structured model. They called this function IICR (Inverse Instantaneous Coalescence Rate) and showed that it does not necessarily correspond to population size changes under non-panmictic models. Besides, most of the methods used to analyse data under models of population structure tend to arbitrarily fix that structure and to minimise or neglect population size changes. Here, we extend the seminal work of Herbots (PhD thesis, University of London, 1994) on the structured coalescent and propose a new framework, the Non-Stationary Structured Coalescent (NSSC) that incorporates demographic events (changes in gene flow and/or deme sizes) to models of nearly any complexity. We show how to compute the IICR under a wide family of stationary and non-stationary models. As an example we address the question of human and Neanderthal evolution and discuss how the NSSC framework allows to interpret genomic data under this new perspective."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Here, we performed three greenhouse experiments using multiple male and female genotypes of the dioecious woody shrub Baccharis salicifolia and its specialist aphid Uroleucon macolai to test for specificity of plant-plant communication with respect to plant sex and genotype. Moreover, we evaluated plant sexual dimorphism and genotypic variation in VOC emissions (i.e., the speaking side of the interaction) and response of plants to VOC exposure (i.e., the listening side of the interaction) in order to identify the chemical mechanisms underlying such specificity. We did not find genotypic specificity of communication; emitter plants damaged by U. macolai significantly reduced subsequent U. macolai performance on receivers, but these effects were indistinguishable for communication within vs. among genotypes. In contrast, we found sex specificity of communication; male emitter plants reduced subsequent U. macolai performance on male and female receiver plants equally, while female emitter plants only did so for female receivers. We found sexual (but not genotypic) dimorphism in speaking but not listening; of the seven compounds induced by U. macolai feeding (speaking), pinocarvone was approximately fivefold greater in female than in male plants, while exposure of plants to pinocarvone emissions (listening) reduced U. macolai performance equally in both male and female plants.

To address this research gap, we manipulated key host immune hormones, then measured the consequences for within-host parasite interactions, and ultimately parasite epidemics in the field. Specifically, we applied plant immune-signalling hormones to sentinel plants, embedded into a wild host population, and tracked foliar infections caused by two common fungal parasites. Within-host individuals, priority effects were altered by the immune-signalling hormone, salicylic acid (SA). Scaling up from within-host interactions, hosts treated with SA experienced a lower prevalence of a less aggressive parasite, increased burden of infection by a more aggressive parasite, and experienced fewer co-infections. Together, these results indicate that by altering within-host priority effects, host immune hormones can drive parasite epidemics. This study therefore experimentally links host immune hormones to within-host priority effects and parasite epidemics, advancing a more mechanistic understanding of how interactions among parasites alter their epidemics."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Sustainable management of shark populations requires improved understanding of migration patterns and population demographics, which has traditionally been sought through physical and/or electronic tagging studies. The application of natural tags such as elemental variations in mineralized band pairs of elasmobranch vertebrae cartilage could also reveal endogenous and exogenous processes experienced by sharks throughout their life histories. Here, elemental profiles were characterized in vertebrae encompassing complete life histories (birth-to-death) of shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), common thresher (Alopias vulpinus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) of known tag and recapture locations in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. All sharks were injected with oxytetracycline at initial capture, released and subsequently recaptured, with individual liberty times ranging from 215 days to 6 years. Vertebral band pairs forming over the liberty intervals were verified by counting the number of band pairs deposited since the oxytetracycline band. Regular oscillations in vertebrae manganese (Mn) content corresponded well with the number of validated band pairs, suggesting that Mn variation could be used to age sharks. Increases in vertebrae barium concentration were correlated with times when individuals occupied areas with high coastal up welling indices, the timing and spatial intensity of which varied from year to year. Interspecific relationships were probably influenced by behavioural differences in horizontal and vertical habitat use, feeding habits and thermoregulatory physiology.

Here, we present OneTwoTree (), a Web-based tool for tree reconstruction based on the supermatrix paradigm. Given a list of taxa names of interest as the sole input requirement, OneTwoTree retrieves all available sequence data from NCBI GenBank, clusters these into orthology groups, identifies the most informative set of markers, searches for an appropriate outgroup, and assembles a partitioned sequence matrix that is then used for the final phylogeny reconstruction step. OneTwoTree further allows users to control various steps of the process, such as the merging of sequences from similar clusters, or phylogeny reconstruction based on markers from a specific genome type. By comparing the performance of OneTwoTree to a manually reconstructed phylogeny of the Antirrhineae tribe, we show that the use of OneTwoTree resulted in substantially higher data coverage in terms of both taxon sampling and the number of informative markers assembled.

They occur throughout the Sonoran Desert region with a distribution spanning a five-fold gradient in mean annual precipitation. Relationships between fitness traits, including stem growth, and spatio-temporal climate patterns are still poorly understood in saguaro, but are assumed to be largely coupled to summer precipitation. To better understand patterns of climate sensitivity in giant saguaro, annual stem growth, carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) in spine tissues, and seasonal variation in stem volume, a proxy for stem water storage, were evaluated over a single growing season (2014) in six widely distributed populations in the northern Sonoran Desert, and over four consecutive growing seasons (2013-2016) in two populations with differences in mean annual precipitation and site moisture (M-i), defined as precipitation amount divided by mean atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. We hypothesized that saguaro growth and delta C-13 would be coupled to a complex suite of climate conditions that include winter precipitation and aridity. Annual stem growth of all populations was generally better correlated to M-i than precipitation alone and was best correlated with M-i measured over the hydrologic year, October 2013-September 2014 (F = 39.8, P {\textless} 0.0001). Likewise, mean delta C-13 increased with M-i, with the highest correlation with M-i calculated for July 2013-August 2014 (F = 38.4.0, P {\textless} 0.0001). Annual stem growth measured across all populations was well correlated to delta C-13 in spines produced during the current year of growth (F = 36.3, P {\textless} 0.0001).

Here, we develop a general theoretical model of how the probability of detecting a species in a discrete sample varies with its mean density in that location based on sampling statistics. We show that detection probability at low densities can be approximated with a simple one parameter saturating function: The probability of detection (P) should increase with the mean number of individuals in a discrete sample (N) as P similar to alpha N/(1 + alpha N). We further show how the parameter alpha will be affected by species spatial aggregation, within-sample observability, and gear catchability. We use the case of the invasive zooplankter, spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), to demonstrate that this theoretical model fits the empirical pattern of detectability. In Lake Mendota, WI, Bythotrephes went undetected despite rigorous long-term zooplankton monitoring (possibly as long as 14 yr with 15 sampling dates/yr). Using our modeling framework, we found that the likelihood of detecting Bythotrephes was low unless peak annual densities exceeded 0.1 individuals/m(3) over multiple years. Despite using models based on Bythotrephes ecology to identify ways to increase detectability, detection probabilities remained low at low densities, such that cases of missed detection such as Lake Mendota are possible despite rigorous monitoring effort. As such, our theoretical model provides a simple rule of thumb for estimating sampling effort required to detect rare species when densities are expected to be low: The minimum samples required (S) to reliably detect a species can be approximated as S similar to(1 + N)/N."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We investigate the phylogeography of white mangroves (Laguncularia racemosa, Combretaceae) and red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Rhizophoraceae) using chloroplast genomes and nuclear markers (thousands of RAD-Seq loci) from individuals throughout the Caribbean. Both coastal tree species have viviparous propagules that can float in salt water for months, meaning they are capable of dispersing long distances. Spatially explicit tests of the role of ocean currents on patterning genetic diversity revealed that ocean currents act as a mechanism for facilitating dispersal, but other means of moving genetic material are also important. We measured pollen- vs. propagule-mediated gene flow and discovered that in white mangroves, seeds were more important for promoting genetic connectivity between populations, but in red mangroves, the opposite was true: pollen contributed more. This result challenges our concept of the importance of both proximity to ocean currents for moving mangrove seeds and the extent of long-distance pollen dispersal. This study also highlights the importance of spatially explicit quantification of both abiotic (ocean currents) and biotic (dispersal) factors contributing to gene flow to understand fully the phylogeographic histories of species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Such conversion of leaf litter into faeces may stimulate decomposition by increasing the surface area available for microbial colonisation. Yet, experimental support for either the outcome or the mechanism of these conversion effects is lacking. Based on the hypothesis that the identity of plant species from which leaf litter is transformed into faeces has a critical role in how faeces decomposition proceeds, we collected faeces of the widely abundant millipede Glomeris marginata fed with leaf litter from seven distinct tree species. We compared the physical and chemical characteristics and the rates of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) loss between litter and faeces. We found that after 100 days of exposure under controlled conditions, C loss was on average higher in faeces (40.0\%) than that in litter (26.6\%), with a significant increase for six of the seven species. Concurrently, N dynamics switched from a net immobilisation (7.7\%) in litter to a net release (14.6\%) in faeces, with a significant increase for five of the seven species. Litter conversion into faeces generally homogenised differences in physical and chemical characteristics among species. Despite such homogenisation, variability in rates of faeces C and N loss among species was similar compared to leaf litter, but correlated with a different set of traits. Specifically, faecal pellet C loss was positively related to compaction (decreased specific area and increased density of faecal pellets), and both C and N loss from faecal pellets were positively related to fragmentation (increased specific area and perimeter of particles within faecal pellets). We conclude that litter fragmentation and compaction into detritivore faecal pellets lead to substantially enhanced decomposition, with a particularly strong impact on N dynamics that changed from immobilisation to net release depending on litter species. Moreover, litter quality control on decomposition is reshuffled by litter conversion into faeces. In ecosystems with high detritivore abundance, this so far largely overlooked pathway of organic matter turnover may strongly affect ecosystem C and N cycling.

We focused on spiders, as the most diversified group of venomous predators, in which a wide variety of trophic strategies have evolved. We conducted a comparative analysis using 40 spider species, in which we measured the size of their venom gland and venom complexity using proteome profiling methods. The species were classified into three trophic groups: generalists, facultative specialists and obligatory specialists. We found that the venom glands of generalists are larger than those of obligatory specialists, which is presumably due to more frequent prey capture by the former. The complexity of venom of peptides (2-15 kDa) and proteins (15-250 kDa) was more diverse in generalists than in specialists. Multivariate analysis of venom revealed significant differences among the three trophic categories only in the complexity of peptides. Our study thus shows that venom gland size and its content have taken different pathways during the evolution of different trophic strategies in spiders. Generalists evolved larger venom glands with more complex composition, whereas obligatory specialists possess smaller glands with less diverse chemical structures."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Although the importance of attached algae and bacteria is widely recognized, the role of the highly abundant biofilm-dwelling micrograzers (i.e., heterotrophic protists and small metazoans) is poorly understood. Studies often highlight the resistance of bacterial biofilms to grazing within the microbial food web and therefore argue that the micrograzers have a modulating role (i.e., have effects on biofilm phenotype) rather than a direct trophic role within biofilms. In the present review, we show that this view comes too short, and we establish a conceptual framework of biofilm food webs consisting of three major elements. (1) Energy pathways and subsidization from plankton. As inhabitants of interfaces, biofilm-dwelling grazers potentially access both planktonic organisms and surface-associated organisms. They can play an important role in importing planktonic production into the biofilm food web and thus in the coupling of the planktonic and benthic food webs. Nevertheless, specialized grazers are also able to utilize significant amounts of autochthonous biofilm production. (2) Horizontal complexity of the basal food web. While bacteria and algae within biofilms are edible in general, food quality and accessibility of both bacteria and algae can differ considerably between different prey phenotypes occurring during biofilm formation with respect to morphology, chemical defense, and nutrient stoichiometry. Instead of considering bacteria and algae within biofilms to be generally resistant to feeding by micrograzers, we suggest considering a horizontal food-quality axis to be at the base of biofilm food webs. This food quality gradient is probably associated with increasing costs for the micrograzers. (3) Vertical food web complexity and food chain length. In addition to the consumption of bacteria and algae, many predatory micrograzers exist within biofilm food webs. With the help of video microscopy, we were able to demonstrate the existence of a complex food web with several trophic levels within biofilms. Our conceptual framework should assist in integrating food web concepts and processes into whole-biofilm budgets and in understanding food-web-related interactions within biofilms."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review"

In forest fragments, edge effects can influence forest regeneration, but little is known about how edge effects influence seedling performance and the interaction between seedlings and their natural enemies over time. 2. In central Amazonia, we recorded survival and growth (in height and leaf number) and damage by insect herbivores and leaf-fungal pathogens of Chrysophyllum pomiferum (Sapotaceae) seedlings that were exposed to different numbers of edges and to different distances from the forest edge. Grown seedlings were transplanted into one-square-metre plots within 1-ha blocks located in the centre (no edge), the edge (one edge), and the corner (two edges), and at different distances from the edge towards the interior (i.e., 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 m) of two rectangular fragments (10- and 100-ha in size). Plots were visited once every 2 months for 1 year (1992-1993) and thereafter every 2 years for almost 8 years (1993-2001). 3. Overall, results showed that seedling survival, height, leaf number, and biotic damage varied over time with the presence of nearby edges and with the distance from the edge. Survival was lower in fragment edges and corners than in centres. Increase in height was similar for all positions within the 100-ha fragment, whereas in the 10-ha fragment seedling height had a greater increase at the edge and corner than in the centre. Furthermore, survival increased with distance from the edge as did leaf number, whereas height showed a lower increase closer to the edge than farther away. 4. Regarding biotic damage, for both fragments herbivory was greater at the centres and decreased with edge proximity over time, whereas leaf-fungal damage was greater at the corners than in the edges and increased significantly over time. Biotic damage was correlated with seedling size. Small seedlings were more susceptible to fungal attack, whereas larger seedlings were so to herbivores. 5. Synthesis. This study demonstrated that despite stochastic environmental factors seedling survival, growth, and biotic damage by herbivores and fungal pathogens varied with the level of edge exposure and proximity, which may threaten forest regeneration in the long term."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can extend the soil volume from which plants acquire phosphorus (P), thus increasing competition for these resources with neighbours. In this study, we tested whether the suppression of hyphal interconnections between neighbour plants mitigates their competitive interactions and consequently affects plant community structure. We used custom-built microcosms that used a wire system to suppress the development of a common mycorrhizal network (CMN) between plant neighbours. We applied this CMN treatment to plants without neighbours (competition-free controls), with conspecific neighbours (monocultures) or with heterospecific neighbours (two and four species communities), all assembled from two pools of four separate temperate grassland species each. We analysed changes in species and community-level productivity and P acquisition. The CMN treatment affected species differently. Most species had reduced shoot biomass while root biomass increased with CMN disconnection. Productivity and nutrient acquisition of Plantago lanceolata in four-species mixtures was negatively affected, leading to a less even distribution of P among species, but community-level P acquisition was not affected. On average, two-species and four-species mixtures produced similar community biomass and had the same P content as monocultures.Synthesis. Common mycorrhizal network disconnection affected competitive interactions among species only little. One explanation may be that the absence of pronounced competitive hierarchy among the species investigated led to relatively symmetric interactions among species that were stable with respects to additional common mycorrhizal network effects. Another explanation is that common mycorrhizal network effects are less important in natural soils with natural arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities than experiments with few arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strains and often sterilized soils suggest."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Predicting the effects of environmental change on wildlife populations therefore requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms through which different environmental drivers interact to generate changes in population size and structure. In this study, we disentangled the roles of temperature, food availability and population density in shaping short- and long-term population dynamics of the African striped mouse, a small rodent inhabiting a semidesert with high intra- and interannual variation in environmental conditions. We parameterized a female-only stage-structured matrix population model with vital rates depending on temperature, food availability and population density, using monthly mark-recapture data from 1609 mice trapped over 9years (2005-2014). We then applied perturbation analyses to determine relative strengths and demographic pathways of these drivers in affecting population dynamics. Furthermore, we used stochastic population projections to gain insights into how three different climate change scenarios might affect size, structure and persistence of this population. We identified food availability, acting through reproduction, as the main driver of changes in both short- and long-term population dynamics. This mechanism was mediated by strong density feedbacks, which stabilized the population after high peaks and allowed it to recover from detrimental crashes. Density dependence thus buffered the population against environmental change, and even adverse climate change scenarios were predicted to have little effect on population persistence (extinction risk over 100years {\textless}5\%) despite leading to overall lower abundances. Explicitly linking environment-demography relationships to population dynamics allowed us to accurately capture past population dynamics. It further enabled establishing the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers, and we conclude that doing this is essential when investigating impacts of climate change on wildlife populations."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In the northeast Atlantic Ocean, recent changes amongst seabird communities are linked to human and climate change impacts on food webs. Many species have declined severely, with food shortages, and increased predation reducing productivity. Arctic skua Stercorarius parasiticus, a kleptoparasite of other seabirds, is one such species. The aim of the study was to determine relative effects of bottom-up and top-down pressures on Arctic skuas across multiple colonies in a rapidly declining national population. Long-term monitoring data were used to quantify changes in population size and productivity of Arctic skuas, their hosts (black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, common guillemot Uria aalge, Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea) and an apex predator (great skua Stercorarius skua) over 24years (1992-2015) in Scotland. We used digital mapping and statistical models to determine relative effects of bottom-up (host productivity) and top-down (great skua density) pressures on Arctic skuas across 33 colonies, and assess variation between three colony types classified by host abundance. Arctic skuas declined by 81\% and their hosts by 42\%-92\%, whereas at most colonies great skuas increased. Annual productivity declined in Arctic skuas and their hosts, and reduced Arctic skua breeding success was a driver of the species' population decline. Arctic skua productivity was positively associated with annual breeding success of hosts and negatively with great skua density. Intercolony variation suggested Arctic skua trends and productivity were most sensitive to top-down pressures at smaller colonies of host species where great skuas had increased most, whereas bottom-up pressures dominated at large colonies of host species. Scotland's Arctic skua population is declining rapidly, with bottom-up and top-down pressures simultaneously reducing breeding success to unsustainably low levels. Marine food web alterations, strongly influenced by fisheries management and climate change, are driving the decline, and this study demonstrates severe vulnerability of seabirds to rapid change in human-modified ecosystems. Potential but untested conservation solutions for Arctic skuas include marine protected areas, supplementary feeding within colonies and management of great skuas."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In Europe, agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been unsuccessful in halting biodiversity declines to any great extent. Two shortcomings of AES include the low farm uptake and the modest efficacy of many AES options. Partly in response to these shortcomings, initiatives encouraging farmers to take an active role in biodiversity conservation have gained in popularity. However, almost no evaluations of such initiatives exist. 2. We evaluated uptake of conservation advice on farms in the Swedish Volunteer \& Farmer Alliance, a BirdLife Sweden-coordinated project aimed at farmland bird conservation, and the response of farmland birds to those actions using farm-level survey data, in a before-after implementation assessment. 3. Uptake was higher for unsubsidised (i.e. non-AES) measures than for AES options, and depended mainly on farmers' interest in nature, with farm size and production type having less importance. 4. In general, abundances of non-crop nesting and field-nesting bird species declined between inventory years (median interval 3 years). Decreases were more marked in agriculturally marginal regions than in more arable-dominated regions, and declines were stronger on organic than on conventional farms. 5. Negative abundance trends among non-crop nesting species were reduced by an increasing number of conservation measures at the farm, but only in the more arable-dominated landscapes. Changes in field-nesting species, or at species level, did not significantly relate to implemented measures, but the power to detect such effects was generally small due to the small sample size of high-uptake farms as well as high inter-farm variability. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that volunteer farmer alliances and the addition of unsubsidised measures may be successful in changing the local number of non-crop nesting farmland birds, at the farm level, particularly in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Thus, unsubsidised measures can be a useful addition to the set of agri-environment tools, although their effects on breeding bird numbers are (as with agri-environmental schemes) dependent on landscape context, as well as on ensuring high on-farm uptake of different interventions."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Recreational fisheries are traditionally managed at local scales, but more effective management could be achieved using a cross-scale approach. To do this, we must first understand how local processes scale up to influence landscape patterns between anglers and resources. We highlight how population-based synchrony methods, used in conjunction with a complex-adaptive-systems framework, can reveal emergent spatial properties within social-ecological systems such as recreational fisheries. 2. Herein, we quantified the level of spatial synchrony in angler behaviour, defined the relationship between angler synchrony and distance among waterbodies, and highlighted social-ecological attributes contributing to these patterns. We leveraged a 111 waterbody-year (34 waterbodies, 5-year collection period) recreational fisheries dataset from Nebraska, USA to address these objectives. 3. Intra-annual patterns in angler behaviour were moderately synchronous across large spatial scales and predominately unrelated to distance among waterbodies. Large-scale synchronous patterns in angler behaviour emerged from local-scale interactions between angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity. 4. Spatial synchrony in angler behaviour is an emergent property that resulted from local-level processes that scaled up to form large-scale patterns. We posit that angler utility in combination with waterbodies sharing these desired utility components caused spatial synchrony among anglers with similar preferences or specializations. The level of spatial synchrony in angler behaviour will therefore depend on the degree of angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity on the landscape, with high or low levels of both leading to low and high levels of spatial synchrony respectively. 5. Synthesis and applications. Synchrony-based methods proved useful for unveiling an emergent property in recreational fisheries that is beneficial for effective cross-scale management. It may not be appropriate to extrapolate information and apply uniform management actions among local waterbodies because angler behaviour was not synchronous at small scales. Rather, anglers respond uniquely to waterbody diversity and therefore substitute waterbodies may be dispersed throughout the landscape. Creating boat access, for example could yield unintended consequences for a particular angler group and cause local and regional shifts in angler behaviour. Evaluating appropriate management options will require a cross-scale monitoring approach that captures angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity at multiple scales."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

The ability to define the spatial dynamics of fish stocks is critical to fisheries management. Combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the regulation of area-based management through physical patrols and port side controls are growing areas of management attention. Augmenting the existing approaches to fisheries management with forensic techniques has the potential to increase compliance and enforcement success rates. 2. We tested the accuracy of three techniques (genotyping, otolith microchemistry and morphometrics) that can be used to identify geographic origin. We used fish caught from three fishing grounds, separated by a minimum of 5 km and a maximum of 60 km, to test the accuracy of these approaches at relatively small spatial scales. 3. Using nearest-neighbour analyses, morphometric analysis was the most accurate (79.5\%) in assigning individual fish to their fishing ground of origin. Neither otolith microchemistry (54.0\%) or genetic analyses (52.4\%) had sufficient accuracy at the spatial scales we examined. 4. Synthesis and applications. The combination of accuracy and minimal resource requirements make morphometric analysis a promising tool for assessing compliance with area-based fishing restrictions at the scale of kilometres. Furthermore, this approach has promising application, in small-scale fisheries through to community-based management approaches where technical and financial resources are limited."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Although there is now evidence that olfaction plays a greater role in primate social life than previously assumed, research on the sense of smell in non-human apes is scarce. Chimpanzees sniff the ground and vegetation on boundary patrols, but the function of this behaviour is unclear. Since chimpanzees are highly territorial and can kill individuals that do not belong to their own community, sniffing might function to gather information about conspecifics, particularly concerning group membership and kinship. To investigate whether chimpanzees recognize group members and kin via olfactory cues, we conducted behavioural bioassays on two groups of chimpanzees at Leipzig Zoo. In a pilot study, we found that chimpanzees responded more strongly to urine than to faeces or body odour. We then presented urine from group members, outgroup individuals and an unscented control in aerated boxes using a simultaneous discrimination task. The first behaviour after a chimpanzee first approached a box was related to olfaction (sniffing, nose within 20 cm, licking) in 83\% of cases, highlighting the importance of olfaction as a general investigation mechanism in this species. Chimpanzees sniffed significantly longer at urine stimuli than the control and significantly longer at odours from outgroup individuals than those from group members. Furthermore, the duration of sniffing was positively correlated with relatedness. Our results suggest that chimpanzees use olfactory cues to obtain information about social relationships and fill a gap in our understanding of primate chemical communication."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Fishing communities and mobile predators can switch among fish species and/or fishing locations with asynchronous dynamics, thereby buffering against variable resource densities (termed `portfolio effects', PEs). However, whether variation among species or locations represent the dominant contributor to PE remains relatively unexplored. Here, we apply a spatio-temporal model to multidecadal time series (1982-2015) for 20 bottom-associated fishes in seven marine ecosystems. For each ecosystem, we compute the reduction in variance over time in total biomass relative to its theoretical maximum if species and locations were perfectly correlated (total PE). We also compute the reduction in variance due to asynchrony among species at each location (species PE) or the reduction due to asynchrony among locations for each species (spatial PE). We specifically compute total, species and spatial PE in 10-year moving windows to detect changes over time. Our analyses revealed that spatial PE are stronger than species PE in six of seven ecosystems, and that ecosystems where species PE is constant over time can exhibit shifts in locations that strongly contribute to PE. We therefore recommend that spatial and total PE be monitored as ecosystem indicators representing risk exposure for human and natural consumers."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

By tracking individually marked females, we were able to estimate the lifetime fitness impacts of phenological advances and delays. We also measured parasitism risk, floral resource use, and nesting behavior to understand how each varies seasonally, and their combined effects on realized fitness. Survival to nesting decreased non-monotonically throughout the season, with a 20.4\% decline in survival rates between the first and second cohorts. The total reproductive output per maternal bee was 14.9\% higher in the second cohort compared to the first, and 161\% higher in the second cohort compared to the third. Combining seasonal patterns in survival and reproductive output, experimentally advanced females showed 30.6\% higher fitness than bees released at the historic peak. In contrast, the nesting phenology of unmanipulated bees showed nearly equal numbers of nesting attempts in the first two cohorts. Both increased resource availability and reduced parasitism risk favored earlier emergence. These results are consistent with a population experiencing directional selection for earlier emergence, adaptive bet-hedging, or developmental constraints.

The application of NDVI as a forage metric is particularly appealing for studying migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in remote Arctic ecosystems, where field assessments are logistically and financially prohibitive, and climate-mediated changes in vegetation have been hypothesized to influence population declines. To determine the utility of NDVI for adequately representing caribou forage conditions, we compared NDVI derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery to empirical measures of caribou forage biomass, nitrogen, digestible nitrogen, and digestible energy within the summer range of the Central Arctic Caribou Herd on the North Slope of Alaska. Specifically, we determined the strength of forage-NDVI relationships at the start of the growing season and across the summer, assessed the efficacy of NDVI variables for modeling spatiotemporal variation in field measurements of different forage components, and used long-term MODIS data to estimate temporal changes in forage between 2000 and 2016. We found that NDVI values were weakly correlated with caribou forage quality at the start of the growing season and throughout the summer. Although linear models of forage-NDVI relationships performed poorly, NDVI variables (NDVI and the number of days from when NDVI reached its maximum value) were useful for modeling spatiotemporal variation in empirical measurements of forage components across the growing season, but only when we incorporated nonlinear forage-NDVI relationships and other habitat covariates. Phenological advances in the date of peak NDVI were associated with significant changes in forage conditions, particularly nitrogen, which exhibited earlier seasonal declines. Using long-term MODIS data, predicted values of forage nitrogen declined between 2000 and 2016, driven by exceedingly low values in 2014 and 2015. Given our results, we caution the application of NDVI as a general (linear) proxy of caribou forage conditions across the growing season, and encourage practitioners to use NDVI variables to model spatiotemporal variation in specific forage conditions from empirical field data, accounting for nonlinear forage-NDVI relationships."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Initial mortality estimates for 2012 varied among tree genera. A rapid damage assessment (RDA) estimated that 65.5 (+/- 7.3) million trees died as a result of the drought in this region one year post-drought. However, this estimate was untested against established monitoring networks. Moreover, pests and physiological damage can elevate tree mortality multiple years beyond a drought event. Since the RDA was unable to quantify multi-year trends, it remained unclear whether these drivers caused increased tree mortality in east Texas beyond one year post-drought and how different species responded over time. To address these questions, we compared total 2012 standing dead tree (SDT) estimates (i.e., drought-killed plus all other SDT excluding harvested or salvaged trees) derived from the RDA and U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data for east Texas. Total SDT estimates did not significantly differ between the RDA (120.5 +/- 8.5 million) and FIA (108.4 +/- 8.7 million). Furthermore, total SDT estimates for the four most common genera (Pinus, Quercus, Liquidambar, Ulmus), which comprised over 80\% of all species, did not significantly differ between the RDA and FIA. Additionally, we used logistic regression and FIA data from east Texas for 2011 through four years post-drought (2012-2015) to examine temporal trends in plot-level drought- and pest-driven tree mortality of seven key species (Pinus taeda, Pinus echinata, Quercus nigra, Quercus stellata, Quercus falcata, Liquidambar styraciflua, Ulmus alata) from the four most common genera. At the plot-level, drought-driven mortality was immediate for the three Quercus species (notably Q. falcata) and L. styraciflua which significantly increased in 2012 while P. taeda mortality was delayed, not increasing significantly until 2013. Pest-driven mortality increased from 2013 to 2015 for all species, with the highest mortality observed in Q. falcata and lowest in P. taeda and U. alata. This study affirms the validity and value of independent sampling efforts to quantify mortality immediately following major disturbance and also demonstrates the need for longer-term species-level assessments beyond the initial year post-drought to account for differential impacts from drought and pests."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Analysis of two amplicon-based data sets containing 101 microsatellites and 376 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 35 locations revealed clear differentiation between populations spawning in rivers flowing into a large marine embayment (Lake Melville) compared to coastal populations. The mechanisms influencing the differentiation of embayment populations were investigated using both multivariate and machine-learning landscape genetic approaches. We identified temperature as the strongest correlate with genetic structure, particularly warm temperature extremes and wider annual temperature ranges. The genomic basis of this divergence was further explored using a subset of locations (n=17) and a 220K SNP array. SNPs associated with spatial structuring and temperature mapped to a diverse set of genes and molecular pathways, including regulation of gene expression, immune response, and cell development and differentiation.

How natural variation in stomata size and density contributes to resolve trade-offs between carbon uptake and water loss in response to local climatic variation is not yet understood. We developed an automated confocal microscopy approach to characterize natural genetic variation in stomatal patterning in 330 fully sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana accessions collected throughout the European range of the species. We compared this to variation in water-use efficiency, measured as carbon isotope discrimination (C-13). We detect substantial genetic variation for stomata size and density segregating within Arabidopsis thaliana. A positive correlation between stomata size and C-13 further suggests that this variation has consequences on water-use efficiency. Genome wide association analyses indicate a complex genetic architecture underlying not only variation in stomatal patterning but also to its covariation with carbon uptake parameters. Yet, we report two novel QTL affecting C-13 independently of stomatal patterning. This suggests that, in A. thaliana, both morphological and physiological variants contribute to genetic variance in water-use efficiency. Patterns of regional differentiation and covariation with climatic parameters indicate that natural selection has contributed to shape some of this variation, especially in Southern Sweden, where water availability is more limited in spring relative to summer. These conditions are expected to favour the evolution of drought avoidance mechanisms over drought escape strategies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Taxonomy explained most variance in elemental composition, even though phylogenetic signals were weak and limited to regional spatial extents and to the family level. The highest elemental contents and lowest carbon:nutrient ratios were found in organisms at high trophic levels and with smaller body size, regardless of geographical location. 4. Carnivores may have higher nutrient content and lower carbon:nutrient ratios than their prey, as organisms optimize growth by choosing the most nutrient-rich resources to consume and then preferentially retain nutrients over carbon in their bodies. Smaller organisms grow proportionally faster than large organisms and so are predicted to have higher nutrient requirements to fuel RNA and protein synthesis. Geography influenced the magnitude, more than the direction, of the ecological and/or phylogenetic effects on elemental composition. 5. Overall, our results show that both ecological (i.e. trophic group) and evolutionary drivers explain among-taxa variation in the elemental content of invertebrates, whereas intraspecific variation is mainly a function of body size. Our findings also demonstrate that restricting analyses of macroinvertebrate stoichiometry solely to either the local scale or species level affects inferences of the patterns in invertebrate elemental content and their underlying mechanisms."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Binomial N-mixture models are commonly applied to analyse population survey data. By estimating detection probabilities, N-mixture models aim at extracting information about abundances in terms of absolute and not just relative numbers. This separation of detection probability and abundance relies on parametric assumptions about the distribution of individuals among sites and of detections of individuals among repeat visits to sites. Current methods for checking assumptions are limited, and their computational complexity has hindered evaluations of their performance. 2. We use simulations and a case study to assess the sensitivity of binomial N-mixture models to overdispersion in abundance and in detection, develop computationally efficient graphical goodness of fit checks to detect it, and evaluate the ability of the checks to identify overdispersion. 3. The simulations show that if the parametric assumptions are not exact the bias in estimated abundances can be severe: underestimation if there is overdispersion in abundance relative to the fitted model and overestimation if there is overdispersion in detection. Our goodness-of-fit checks performed well in detecting lack of fit when the abundance distribution was overdispersed, but struggled to detect lack of fit when detections were overdispersed. We show that the inability to detect lack of fit due to overdispersed detection is caused by a fundamental similarity between N-mixture models with beta-binomial detections and N-mixture models with negative binomial abundances. 4. The strong biases that can occur in the binomial N-mixture model when the distribution of individuals among sites, or the detection model, is mis-specified implies that checking goodness of fit is essential for sound inference about abundance. To check the assumptions we provide computationally efficient goodness of fit checks that are available in an R-package nmixgof. However, even when a binomial N-mixture model appears to fit the data well, estimates are not robust in the presence of overdispersion. We show that problems can occur even when estimated detection probabilities are high, and that previously reported problems with negative binomial models cannot always be diagnosed by checking the sensitivity of abundance estimates to numerical cutoff values used in likelihood computations."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Climate change will lead to increases in drought severity and frequency, but how canopy nutrients will respond to drought, and how these responses may vary with community composition along aridity gradients is poorly understood. We experimentally addressed this issue by reducing precipitation amounts by 66\% during two consecutive growing seasons at three sites located along a natural aridity gradient. This allowed us to assess drought effects on canopy nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in arid and semiarid grasslands of northern China. Along the aridity gradient, canopy nutrient concentrations were positively related to aridity, with this pattern was driven primarily by species turnover (i.e., an increase in the relative biomass of N- and P-rich species with increasing aridity). In contrast, drought imposed experimentally increased N but decreased P concentrations in plant canopies. These changes were driven by the combined effects of species turnover and intraspecific variation in leaf nutrient concentrations. In addition, the sensitivity of canopy N and P concentrations to drought varied across the three sites. Canopy nutrient concentrations were less affected by drought at drier than wetter sites, because of the opposing effects of species turnover and intraspecific variation, as well as greater drought tolerance for nutrient-rich species. These contrasting effects of long-term aridity vs. short-term drought on canopy nutrient concentrations, as well as differing sensitivities among sites in the same grassland biome, highlight the challenge of predicting ecosystem responses to future climate change."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

As a consequence, ambient temperature has been considered the most important external factor driving the evolution of residual BMR. It is not clear, however, whether this relationship is size dependent, and artifacts such as the biased sampling of body masses in physiological data sets could cause us to overstate the ubiquity of the relationship. Accordingly, here we used published data on body mass (m(b)), BMR, and annual mean temperature (Tmean) for 458 mammal species (and/or subspecies) to examine the size dependence of the relationship between temperature and BMR. We found a significant interaction between m(b) and Tmean as predictors of residual BMR, such that the effect of Tmean on residual BMR decreases as a function of m(b). In line with this, the amount of residual variance in BMR explained by Tmean decreased with increasing m(b), from 20\%-30\% at body sizes of less than 100 g to almost 0 at body sizes greater than 1,000 g. These data suggest that our current understanding of the importance of broad-scale variation in ambient temperature as a driver of metabolic evolution in endotherms probably is affected by the large number of small species in both nature and physiological data sets."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We analyzed {\textgreater}6,000 trophic interactions of 52 populations from four tropical frog species along a gradient of prey limitation. The mean of PPSR and its variance differed up to two orders of magnitude across and within food webs. Importantly, as prey availability decreased across food webs, PPSR and its variance became more size dependent. Thus, trophic interactions did not follow a fixed allometric scaling but changed predictably with the strength of prey limitation. Our results emphasize the importance of ecological contexts in arranging food webs and the need to incorporate ecological drivers of PPSR and its variance in food web and community models."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Association of plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may act as either an equalizing or a stabilizing mechanism of coexistence, but the effect of the symbiosis likely depends on the responsiveness to fungi of plant species within a community, rather than simply as a binary metric based on presence or absence of AM fungi. Here, we test the hypothesis that communities consisting of plants that are unresponsive to mycorrhiza, or that differ widely in their response to mycorrhiza, would exhibit larger differences in their niche and fitness resulting to weaker plant-plant competition. 2. We took two complementary approaches to test our hypotheses: first, we reanalysed data from the classic BIODEPTH grassland biodiversity manipulation experiment to assess niche and relative fitness differences of plant communities solely comprising species considered to be either obligate or facultative symbiotrophs. Second, we assembled replicate synthetic plant communities comprising all 70 possible four-species mixtures from a pool of eight species in the presence of an AM fungus to assess pairwise competition coefficients and infer coexistence potential. The species were characteristic of pastures, had an identical CSR survival strategy, and in nature differ in their extent of colonization by AM fungi. We separately established monocultures to estimate competition coefficients and assess plant responsiveness to mycorrhiza. 3. Analysis of data from BIODEPTH showed that plant communities comprising solely species with obligate associations with AM fungi had greater niche and fitness differences compared with communities comprising species without obligate associations with AM fungi. In the manipulation experiment, we found that plants that depended on AM fungi competed more strongly than plants with little dependence on AM fungi. The weakest competition was between AM-responsive and AM-unresponsive plant species. Coexistence was more likely in pairwise combinations in which at least one of the plant species responded negatively to mycorrhiza. 4. Synthesis. We directly quantified variation in niche and fitness differences between plant species due to interaction with AM fungi. Integrating this knowledge into explicit competition models in plant community ecology could greatly enhance our ability to predict coexistence in nature."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two important characteristics of alpine plants to overcome the threats caused by global changes. Among alpine species, Arabis alpina is characterised by an unusually wide altitudinal amplitude, ranging from 800 to 3,100 m of elevation in the French Alps. Two non-exclusive hypotheses can explain the presence of A. alpina across this broad ecological gradient: adaptive phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation, making this species especially useful to better understand these phenomena in alpine plant species. 2. We carried out common garden experiments at two different elevations with maternal progenies from six sites that differed in altitude. We showed that (1) key phenotypic traits (morphotype, total fruit length, growth, height) display significant signs of local adaptation, (2) most traits studied are characterised by a high phenotypic plasticity between the two experimental gardens and (3) the two populations from the highest elevations lacked morphological plasticity compared to the other populations. 3. By combining two genome scan approaches (detection of selection and association methods), we isolated a candidate gene (Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase 1). This gene was associated with height and local average temperature in our studied populations, consistent with previous studies on this gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. 4. Synthesis. Given the nature of the traits involved in the detected pattern of local adaptation and the relative lack of plasticity of the two most extreme populations, our findings are consistent with a scenario of a locally adaptive stress response syndrome in high elevation populations. Due to a reduced phenotypic plasticity, an overall low intra-population genetic diversity of the adaptive traits and weak gene flow, populations of high altitude might have difficulties to cope with, e.g. a rise of temperature."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Aggregated distributions of parasite individuals across host individuals are nearly ubiquitous among parasitic taxa. The size and sex ratio of the population of one parasite species infecting a single host (hereafter infrapopulation) can influence parasite fitness through intraspecific competition, mate availability and the ability to attract vectors for transmission of parasite propagules. Competition for resources and for pollen and seed vector services may limit reproductive success (pollen receipt, fruit production and seed dispersal) in large infrapopulations of parasitic plants, while mate limitation or reduced ability to attract vectors may limit this success in small infrapopulations. 2. Using a dioecious parasitic plant, desert mistletoe Phoradendron californicum, we experimentally removed reproductive tissue from male parasites in whole infrapopulations to test for independent effects of infrapopulation size and within-host mate availability on female fitness. As desert mistletoe requires both pollen and seed vectors for successful reproduction, the species provides the opportunity to test how infrapopulation characteristics affect multiple components of parasite fitness. 3. We found that insect-mediated pollen receipt decreased for parasites on treated hosts, consistent with within-host mate limitation. Additionally, the relationship between mate availability and fruit production per flower ranged from neutral to positive depending on year of the experiment. 4. As expected if competition for host resources limits reproductive success more than mate availability in larger infrapopulations, the greater pollen receipt to females in large infrapopulations did not generally translate into increased mistletoe fruit production. Relationships between mistletoe fruit production per flower and infrapopulation size ranged from negative to neutral. 5. Both pollen receipt and pollinator visitation increased with infrapopulation size, indicating that larger populations can be more attractive to pollen vectors independent of mate availability. However, we found no relationship between infrapopulation size and fruit removal by dispersers and, thus, no evidence that attraction of seed dispersal vectors increases with infrapopulation size. 6. Synthesis. These results highlight the interactive roles of within-host processes (resource competition, mate availability and vector attraction) in determining the fitness of biotically transmitted parasite individuals."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In the Great Basin region of the western United States, woody and herbaceous fuel treatments are implemented to decrease the effects of wildfire and increase sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to exotic annual grasses. High cover of the exotic annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) after treatments increases fine fuels, which in turn increases the risk of passing over a biotic threshold to a state of increased wildfire frequency and conversion to cheatgrass dominance. Sagebrush ecosystem resilience to wildfire and resistance to cheatgrass depend on climatic conditions and abundance of perennial herbaceous species that compete with cheatgrass. In this study, we used longer-term data to evaluate the relationships among soil climate conditions, perennial herbaceous cover, and cheatgrass cover following fuel management treatments across the environmental gradients that characterize sagebrush ecosystems in the Great Basin. We examined the effects of woody and herbaceous fuel treatments on soil temperature, soil water availability (13-30 and 50 cm depths), and native and exotic plant cover on six sagebrush sites lacking pinon (Pinus spp.) or juniper (Juniperus spp.) tree expansion and 11 sagebrush sites with tree expansion. Both prescribed fire and mechanical treatments increased soil water availability on woodland sites and perennial herbaceous cover on some woodland and sagebrush sites. Prescribed fire also slightly increased soil temperatures and especially increased cheatgrass cover compared to no treatment and mechanical treatments on most sites. Non-metric dimensional scaling ordination and decision tree partition analysis indicated that sites with warmer late springs and warmer and wetter falls had higher cover of cheatgrass. Sites with wetter winters and early springs (March-April) had higher cover of perennial herbs. Our findings suggest that site resistance to cheatgrass after fire and fuel control treatments decreases with a warmer and drier climate. This emphasizes the need for management actions to maintain and enhance perennial herb cover, such as implementing appropriate grazing management, and revegetating sites that have low abundance of perennial herbs in conjunction with fuel control treatments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In this study, we utilized stable isotope analysis to determine resource use of YCAs in naturally occurring low- and high-density populations, and we conducted laboratory experiments mimicking availability of honeydew to measure effects of carbohydrate subsidies on colony growth and worker behavior. High-density YCA populations in nature incorporated a larger proportion of plant-based resources in their diet than low-density populations, and laboratory colonies with access to greater sugar resources had larger colony sizes, higher reproduction rates and worker survival, and higher per capita activity levels and showed higher aggression and potency toward opponents.

If the selection pressures act in opposite directions in males and females, we refer to this as (inter-) sexual conflict or sexual antagonism (Arnqvist \& Rowe, 2005). Testing if sexual conflict maintains genetic variation in natural populations is a tremendous challengeit requires both identifying loci that harbor sexually antagonistic alleles and determining whether those alleles are maintained as stable polymorphisms (Mank, 2017).

Maternal investment is costly to the mother but essential to offspring survival in altrical species. Infanticide by novel males results in loss of maternal investment, and maternal strategies have evolved to mitigate these losses. One such maternal strategy, the Bruce effect, involves spontaneous abortion by females of some mammal species when exposed to a novel male during pregnancy. 2. In mice, the Bruce effect only occurs during early pregnancy, but we have previously found that female mice exposed to a novel male's scent in late pregnancy weaned smaller offspring. Here, we replicate that manipulation to resolve the cause of the reduced weaning weight and subsequent effects on offspring fitness. 3. Females exposed to an unfamiliar male's scent in late pregnancy spent significantly less time nursing their pups during lactation, suggesting that reduced maternal allocation contributes to slower offspring growth. The offspring with a reduced weaning weight exhibited catch-up growth and reached a normal weight at adulthood. These offspring, however, were found to bear oxidative damage in adulthood, revealing long-term effects on offspring condition. 4. We conclude that female mice strategically alter their investment in lactation in relation to the likelihood of infanticide, but that this results in long-term fitness costs to their offspring."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

The monkeys had free access to natural foods throughout the year, and to ensure that any seasonal differences in nutrient intake were due to homeostatic compensation and not constraints on food availability, we studied the monkeys during periods in which they were provisioned with the same amount of supplementary foods in winter and spring. 3. Thermoregulatory energy costs in winter and spring were calculated using partitional calorimetric estimations of convective and radiative heat loss obtained from thermal imaging of free-ranging monkeys in situ. Daily nutrient intakes were measured using continuous focal follows (average 6.9hr/day) of free-ranging individuals (27 days in spring and 28 days in winter). 4. We used a nutritional geometry framework to integrate these data and test three predictions: (a) In order to remain thermoneutral (balance heat loss with heat expenditure), golden snub-nosed monkeys increase daily energy consumption during the winter compared to spring; (b) this increase is achieved specifically by increasing intake of the primary energetic nutrients, carbohydrate and lipid, relative to protein; and (c) the seasonal increase in ingested fat and carbohydrate calories will quantitatively match the additional thermoregulatory costs in winter compared with spring. 5. Our results showed that daily metabolisable energy intake in winter (721.5 kJ/mbm) was 1.8 times that in spring (399 kJ/mbm). As predicted, this difference was specific to fat and carbohydrate, whereas seasonal protein intake did not differ significantly. Winter consumption of fat and carbohydrate was 326 kJ/mbm per day greater than in spring, a value that closely matched the seasonal difference in the daily energetic costs of thermoregulation (329 kJ/mbm). 6.

Given the direct costs to females associated with multiple mating, which include reductions in lifespan and lifetime reproductive success, past research focused on identifying potential indirect benefits (through increases in offspring fitness) that females may accrue. Far less attention has, however, been devoted to understanding how costs of sexual interactions to females may extend across generations. Hence, little is known about the transgenerational implications of variation in mating rates, or the net consequences of maternal sexual activities across generations. Using the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, a model system for the study of sexual conflict, we investigate the effects of mating with multiple males versus a single male, and tease apart effects due to sexual harassment and those due to mating per se, over three generations. A multigenerational analysis indicated that females that were exposed to ongoing sexual harassment and who also were permitted to mate with multiple males showed no difference in net fitness compared to females that mated just once without ongoing harassment. Intriguingly, however, females that were continually harassed, but permitted to mate just once, suffered a severe decline in net fitness compared to females that were singly (not harassed) or multiply mated (harassed, but potentially gaining benefits via mating with multiple males). Overall, the enhanced fitness in multiply mated compared to harassed females may indicate that multiple mating confers transgenerational benefits. These benefits may counteract, but do not exceed (i.e., we found no difference between singly and multiply mated females), the large transgenerational costs of harassment. Our study highlights the importance of examining transgenerational effects from an inclusive (looking at both indirect benefits but also costs) perspective, and the need to investigate transgenerational effects across several generations if we are to fully understand the consequences of sexual interactions, sexual conflict evolution, and the interplay of sexual conflict and multi-generational costs and benefits."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

The amphibian cutaneous microbiome is widely studied for its potential to mitigate disease-mediated amphibian declines. Other microbial interactions in this system, however, have been largely neglected in the context of disease outbreaks. European fire salamanders have suffered dramatic population crashes as a result of the newly emerged Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). In this paper, we investigate microbial interactions on multiple fronts within this system. We show that wild, healthy fire salamanders maintain complex skin microbiotas containing Bsal-inhibitory members, but these community are present at a remarkably lowabundance. Through experimentation, we show that increasing bacterial densities of Bsal-inhibiting bacteria via daily addition slowed disease progression in fire salamanders. Additionally, we find that experimental-Bsal infection elicited subtle changes in the skin microbiome, with selected opportunistic bacteria increasing in relative abundance resulting in septicemic events that coincide with extensive destruction of the epidermis. These results suggest that fire salamander skin, in natural settings, maintains bacterial communities at numbers too low to confer sufficient protection against Bsal, and, in fact, the native skin microbiota can constitute a source of opportunistic bacterial pathogens that contribute to pathogenesis. By shedding light on the complex interaction between the microbiome and a lethal pathogen, these data put the interplay between skin microbiomes and a wildlife disease into a new perspective."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

To a considerable extent, the distribution of this diversity is driven by environmental factors such as climate or coast access. An unresolved question is whether the relevant factors have remained constant over time. Here, we address this question at a global scale. We approximate the difference between pre-versus post-Neolithic populations by the difference between modern hunter-gatherer versus food-producing populations. Using a novel geostatistical approach of estimating language and language family densities, we show that environmental-chiefly climate factors-have driven the language density of food-producing populations considerably more strongly than the language density of hunter-gatherer populations. Current evidence suggests that the population dynamics of modern hunter-gatherers is very similar to that of what can be reconstructed from the Palaeolithic record. Based on this, we cautiously infer that the impact of environmental factors on language densities underwent a substantial change with the transition to agriculture. After this transition, the environmental impact on language diversity in food-producing populations has remained relatively stable since it can also be detected-albeit in slightly weaker form-in models that capture the reduced linguistic diversity during large-scale language spreads in the Mid-Holocene."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Previous observations of insect species suggest that (i) sibling cooperation is more likely when siblings hatch at the same time, and (ii) this is more common when parents provide little to no care. In this paper, we tested these ideas experimentally with the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides. Burying beetles convert the body of a small dead vertebrate into an edible nest for their larvae, and provision and guard their young after hatching. In our first experiment, we simulated synchronous or asynchronous hatching by adding larvae at different intervals to the carrion-breeding resource. We found that `synchronously' hatched broods survived better than `asynchronously' hatched broods, probably because `synchronous hatching' generated larger teams of larvae, that together worked more effectively to penetrate the carrion nest and feed upon it. In our second experiment, we measured the synchronicity of hatching in experimental populations that had evolved for 22 generations without any post-hatching care, and control populations that had evolved in parallel with post-hatching care. We found that larvae were more likely to hatch earlier, and at the same time as their broodmates, in the experimental populations that evolved without post-hatching care. We suggest that synchronous hatching enables offspring to help each other when parents are not present to provide care. However, we also suggest that greater levels of cooperation among siblings cannot compensate fully for the loss of parental care."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

However, one of the most common and taxonomically widespread antipredator behaviours of all has, remarkably, received almost no experimental attention: so-called `protean' behaviour. This is behaviour that is sufficiently unpredictable to prevent a predator anticipating in detail the future position or actions of its prey. In this study, we used human `predators' participating in 3D virtual reality simulations to test how protean (i.e. unpredictable) variation in prey movement affects participants' ability to visually target them as they move (a key determinant of successful predation). We found that targeting accuracy was significantly predicted by prey movement path complexity, although, surprisingly, there was little evidence that high levels of unpredictability in the underlying movement rules equated directly to decreased predator performance. Instead, the specific movement rules differed in how they impacted on targeting accuracy, with the efficacy of protean variation in one element depending on the values of the remaining elements. These findings provide important insights into the understudied phenomenon of protean antipredator behaviour, which are directly applicable to predator-prey dynamics within a broad range of taxa."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Geochemical proxies for carbonate chemistry within the calcifying fluid (cf) of both species indicated that only mean seawater pH influenced pH(cf). pH treatments had no effect on proxies for Omega(cf).

But it is not clear in most species whether this reflects very broad tolerance of climate conditions, or a high degree of genetic differentiation or phenotypic acclimation in their responses to local climate. Provenance trials and common garden experiments indicate that at least some tree species of the temperate forests of eastern North America show genetic differentiation in growth as a function of climate, although these studies have been largely limited to measurements on growth of seedlings and saplings. To test for evidence of either adaptation or acclimation in adult response to local climatic conditions, we used data from over 23,000 tree cores collected by the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis program in the 1980s for 14 tree species distributed in states from Maine to Ohio. We tested a suite of alternate models for interannual variation in radial growth as a function of (1) tree age, (2) size, (3) temperature, and (4) precipitation. The models included climate variables from both the current and previous year. The alternate models allowed us to test whether growth was best predicted from absolute values of the climate variables, or from deviation of current or previous year climate from long-term average at the location of an individual tree core. In all 14 species, models that used deviation from local, long-term mean climate were superior, indicating that all 14 species showed strong adaptation or acclimation to local climate. In most of the species, growth was highest in years that were cooler and wetter than long-term average at a location. The analysis does not allow us to distinguish between genetic differentiation and phenotypic acclimation responses. If the results are genetically based, trees within a given location could be much more sensitive to climate change than indicated by the very broad geographic distributions of these temperate tree species, but if the results are phenotypic, this would represent local acclimation that could help buffer species in the face of climate change."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Here, we conduct a single-sample evaluation of genetic erosion within contemporary populations of the Australian lungfish. Genetic erosion is a temporal decline in intraspecific diversity due to factors such as reduced population size and inbreeding. We examined whether young individuals showed signs of reduced genetic diversity and/or inbreeding using a novel bomb radiocarbon dating method to age lungfish nonlethally, based on C-14 ratios of scales. A total of 15,201 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci were genotyped in 92 individuals ranging in age from 2 to 77years old. Standardized individual heterozygosity and individual inbreeding coefficients varied widely within and between riverine populations, but neither was associated with age, so perceived problems with recruitment have not translated into genetic erosion that could be considered a proximate threat to lungfish populations. Conservation concern has surrounded Australian lungfish for over a century. However, our results suggest that long-lived threatened species can maintain stable levels of intraspecific variability when sufficient reproductive opportunities exist over the course of a long lifespan."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

A combination of timing of and body condition (i.e., mass) at arrival on the breeding grounds interact to influence the optimal combination of the timing of reproduction and clutch size in migratory species. This relationship has been formalized by Rowe et al. in a condition-dependent individual optimization model (American Naturalist, 1994, 143, 689-722), which has been empirically tested and validated in avian species with a capital-based breeding strategy. 2. This model makes a key, but currently untested prediction; that variation in the rate of body condition gain will shift the optimal combination of laying date and clutch size. This prediction is essential because it implies that individuals can compensate for the challenges associated with late timing of arrival or poor body condition at arrival on the breeding grounds through adjustment of their life history investment decisions, in an attempt to maximize fitness. 3. Using an 11-year data set in arctic-nesting common eiders (Somateria mollissima), quantification of fattening rates using plasma triglycerides (an energetic metabolite), and a path analysis approach, we test this prediction of this optimization model; controlling for arrival date and body condition, females that fatten more quickly will adjust the optimal combination of lay date and clutch size, in favour of a larger clutch size. 4. As predicted, females fattening at higher rates initiated clutches earlier and produced larger clutch sizes, indicating that fattening rate is an important factor in addition to arrival date and body condition in predicting individual variation in reproductive investment. However, there was no direct effect of fattening rate on clutch size (i.e., birds laying on the same date had similar clutch sizes, independent of their fattening rate). Instead, fattening rate indirectly affected clutch size via earlier lay dates, thus not supporting the original predictions of the optimization model. 5. Our results demonstrate that variation in the rate of condition gain allows individuals to shift flexibly along the seasonal decline in clutch size to presumably optimize the combination of laying date and clutch size."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

As current research focuses on artificial administration of OT in asocial tasks, little is known about how the hormone in its naturally occurring state actually impacts behaviour in social interactions. Using a new optimal foraging paradigm, the `egg hunt', we assessed the association of endogenous OT with helping behaviour and conversation. We manipulated players' group membership relative to each other prior to an egg hunt, during which they had repeated opportunities to spontaneously help each other. Results show that endogenous baseline OT predicted helping and conversation type, but crucially as a function of group membership. Higher baseline OT predicted increased helping but only between in-group players, as well as decreased discussion about individuals' goals between in-group players but conversely more of such discussion between out-group players. Subsequently, behaviour but not conversation during the hunt predicted change in OT, in that out-group members who did not help showed a decrease in OT from baseline levels.

It remains unclear how human activities influence the top-down and bottom-up forces that regulate the distribution and succession of these salt marshes and lead to the degradation of the red beaches. We examined how bottom-up forces influenced the germination, emergence, and colonization of saline seepweed with field measurements and a laboratory experiment. We also examined whether top-down forces affected the red beach distribution by conducting a field survey for crab burrows and density, laboratory feeding trials, and waterbird investigations. The higher sediment accretion rate induced by human activities limited the establishment of new red beaches. The construction of tourism facilities and the frequent presence of tourists reduced the density of waterbirds, which in turn increased the density of crabs, intensifying the top-down forces such as predators and herbivores that drive the degradation of the coastal red beaches. Our results show that sediment accretion and plant-herbivory changes induced by human activities were likely the two primary ecological processes leading to the degradation of the red beaches. Human activities significantly shaped the abundance and distribution of the red beaches by altering both top-down and bottom-up ecological processes.

To secure mating opportunities, males often develop and maintain conspicuous traits that are involved in intrasexual and/or intersexual competition. While current models of sexual selection rely on the assumption that producing such traits is costly, quantifying the cost of allocating to secondary sexual traits remains challenging. 2. According to the principle of allocation, high energy allocation to growth or sexual traits in males should lead to reduced energy allocation to the maintenance of cellular and physiological functions, potentially causing them to age faster, with impaired survival. 3. We evaluated the short-term and delayed consequences of energy allocation to antlers early in life in two contrasted populations of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus. Although most males mate successfully for the first time in their fourth year, antlers are grown annually from the first year of life onwards. We tested the prediction that a high level of allocation to antler growth during the first two years of life should lead to lower body mass, antler size and survival during the early and late prime stages, as well as to reduced longevity overall. 4. Growing and carrying long antlers during the first years of life was not associated with any detectable cost in the late prime stage. The positive association between antler growth in early life and adult body mass instead supports that fawn antler acts as an honest signal of phenotypic quality in roe deer. 5. For a given body mass, yearling males growing longer antlers displayed impaired performance during their late prime. We also found a trend for a short-term survival cost of allocation to relative antler length during the second year of life. 6.Yearling males that grow long antlers relative to their mass might display a fast life-history tactic. We argue that differential allocation to secondary sexual traits generates a diversity of individual trajectories that should impact population dynamics."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

While theoretical models predict reproductive allocation (RA) should approach 100\% of available energy as a plant ages, available empirical data suggest much lower RA values in perennial plants. In this study, we have two aims. First, we assess whether the discrepancy between theory and data arises from methodological differences in how growth and RA are calculated. Specifically, we hypothesize RA in older plants is large when compared to growth in leaf area, that is, after excluding turnover of stem and leaf tissues. Second, we hypothesize that species with cheap tissues or those that are shorter reach RA = 0.5 at a younger age. 2. We measured investment in leaf, stem and reproduction on individuals from 14 co-occurring woody perennial iteroparous species. A fire chronosequence allowed us to use a space-for-time substitution to estimate RA schedules for each species, simultaneously measuring reproductive and vegetative production on individuals differing in age. 3. For most (11 of 14) species, we found RA eventually reached 100\% of available energy, with another two species reaching at least 80\%. Increases in RA were associated with a decline in growth of leaf area. Comparing species, we found that species with cheap leaves reached RA = 0.5 sooner (they could be called fast-living), whereas delayed maturation and slower increases in RA were associated with greater maximum height. 4. Synthesis. Explicitly accounting for the cost of leaf replacement leads to the high estimates of reproductive allocation in perennial plants predicted by theoretical models, limiting or even halting leaf area expansion. For some species, so much energy is allocated to reproduction that leaf area declines year-upon-year for multiple growing seasons preceding death.

Dead wood is a habitat for numerous fungal species, many of which are important agents of decomposition. Previous studies suggested that wood-inhabiting fungal communities are affected by climate, availability of dead wood in the surrounding landscape and characteristics of the colonized dead-wood object( e.g. host tree species). These findings indicate that different filters structure fungal communities at different scales, but how these factors individually drive fungal fruiting diversity on dead-wood objects is unknown. 2. We conducted an orthogonal experiment comprising 180 plots( 0.1 ha) in a random block design and measured fungal fruit body richness and community composition on 720 dead-wood objects over the first 4 years of succession. The experiment allowed us to disentangle the effects of the host( beech and fir; logs and branches) and the environment( microclimate: sunny and shady plots; local dead wood: amount and heterogeneity of dead wood added to plot). 3. Variance partitioning revealed that the host was more important than the environment for the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi. A more detailed model revealed that host tree species had the highest independent effect on richness and community composition of fruiting species of fungi. Host size had significant but low independent effects on richness and community composition of fruiting species. Canopy openness significantly affected the community composition of fruiting species. By contrast, neither local amount nor heterogeneity of dead wood significantly affected the fungal diversity measures. 4. Synthesis. Our study identified host tree species as a more important driver of the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi than the environment, which suggests a hostcentred filter of this diversity in the early phase of the decomposition process. For the conservation of wood-inhabiting fungi, a high variety of host species in various microclimates is more important than the availability of dead wood at the stand level."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Northern forest ecosystems are projected to experience warmer growing seasons, as well as winters with reduced snowpack depth and duration. Reduced snowpack will expose soils to cold winter air and lead to increased frequency of freeze-thaw cycles. The interactions between warmer soils in the growing season and colder soils in winter may have important implications for the phenology, productivity and nutrient content of forest plants. 2. We conducted an experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, USA, to examine the effects of growing season warming, reduced depth and duration of winter snowpack, as well as increased frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles on sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer rubrum) saplings. We examined the direct effects of soil temperatures on plant root health, timing of leaf-out, foliar nitrogen, rates of photosynthesis and growth, as well as the indirect effects of snowpack reduction on herbivory on plant stems. 3. A smaller winter snowpack and increased frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles in winter led to increased root damage and delayed leaf-out for maple saplings. Snowpack reduction decreased rates of stem herbivory in winter, indicating that alleviation of above-ground stem damage in winters with reduced snowpack may offset the root damage incurred from successive soil freeze-thaw cycles in winters with low snowpack. 4. Synthesis. By examining the response of two dominant tree species to simulated climate change in both the growing season and winter, we find that plant responses are mediated through a combination of changes in soil temperature and plant-herbivore interactions that differentially affect above- and below-ground plant components. These results highlight the feedbacks between trophic levels that shape forest function and demonstrate the need for considering climate change across seasons in global change experiments to determine how forest function may change in the future."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Biotic resistance represents an important natural barrier to potential invaders throughout the world, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive such resistance are still debated. In theory, native communities should repel both functionally similar invaders which compete for the same resources, and invaders which possess less competitive traits. However, environmental stress, trade-offs across vital rates and competition-induced plastic trait shifts may modify expected competitive outcomes, thereby influencing invasion dynamics. 2. In order to test these theoretical links between trait distributions and biotic resistance, we performed a mesocosm experiment with 25 non-native ornamental species invading native plant communities. Each non-native species was grown with and without the native community under two watering treatments (regular and reduced). We measured biotic resistance as the difference in performance of non-native individuals grown with and without the community in terms of their survival, growth and reproduction. We quantified overall functional dissimilarity between non-native ornamental individuals and native communities based on the combination of plant height, specific leaf area and seed mass. Then, assuming each of these traits is also potentially linked to competitive ability, we measured the position of non-natives on trait hierarchies. While height is positively correlated with competitive ability for light interception, conservative leaf and seed characteristics provide greater tolerance to competition for other resources. Finally, we quantified plastic trait shifts of non-native individuals induced by competition. 3. Indeed, the native community repelled functionally similar individuals by lowering the invader's survival rate. Simultaneously, shorter ornamental individuals with larger specific leaf areas were less tolerant to biotic resistance from the community across vital rates, although the effect of trait hierarchies often depended on watering conditions. Finally, non-natives responded to competition by shifting their traits. Most importantly, individuals with more competitive traits were able to overcome biotic resistance also through competition-induced plastic trait shifts. 4. Synthesis. Our results highlight that both functional dissimilarity and trait hierarchies mediate biotic resistance to ornamental plant invaders. Nevertheless, environmental stress as well as opposing trends across vital rates are also influential. Furthermore, plastic trait shifts can reinforce potential invaders' competitive superiority, determining a positive feedback."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Although additive genetic variation and novel combinations of parental genes theoretically increase the potential for hybrid species to adapt, few empirical studies have investigated the adaptive potential within a hybrid species. Here, we address whether genomic contingencies, adaptation to climate, or diet best explain divergence in beak morphology using genomically diverged island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae from Crete, Corsica, and Sicily. Populations vary significantly in beak morphology both between and within islands of origin. Temperature seasonality best explains population divergence in beak size. Interestingly, beak shape along all significant dimensions of variation was best explained by annual precipitation, genomic composition, and their interaction, suggesting a role for contingencies. Moreover, beak shape similarity to a parent species correlates with proportion of the genome inherited from that species, consistent with the presence of contingencies. In conclusion, adaptation to local conditions and genomic contingencies arising from putatively independent hybridization events jointly explain beak morphology in the Italian sparrow. Hence, hybridization may induce contingencies and restrict evolution in certain directions dependent on the genetic background."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Yet it remains unclear how evolution may affect the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions. Here, we address this issue by analyzing an eco-evolutionary model of phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions with explicit nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics. In our model, investment of phytoplankton in nitrogen versus phosphorus uptake is an evolving trait, and zooplankton display selectivity for phytoplankton with N:P ratios matching their nutritional requirements. We use this model to explore implications of the contrasting N:P requirements of copepods versus cladocerans. The model predicts that selective zooplankton strongly affect the N:P ratio of phytoplankton, resulting in deviations from their optimum N:P ratio. Specifically, selective grazing by nitrogen-demanding copepods favors dominance of phytoplankton with low N:P ratios, whereas phosphorus-demanding cladocerans favor dominance of phytoplankton with high N:P ratios. Interestingly, selective grazing by nutritionally balanced zooplankton leads to the occurrence of alternative stable states, where phytoplankton may evolve either low, optimum, or high N:P ratios, depending on the initial conditions. These results offer a new perspective on commonly observed differences in N:P stoichiometry between plankton of freshwater and those of marine ecosystems and indicate that selective grazing by zooplankton can have a major impact on the stoichiometric composition of phytoplankton."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Genetic controls for upper and lower molars appear somewhat similar, and regions containing genes implied in dental defects drive this variation. We mapped three relationship QTLs (rQTL) modifying the control of the mesial molars on the focal third molar. These regions overlap Shh, Sostdc1, and Fst genes, which have pervasive roles in development and should be buffered against new variation.

Measuring mammal biodiversity in tropical rainforests is challenging, and methods that reduce effort while maximizing success are crucial for long-term monitoring programmes. Commonly used methods to assess mammal biodiversity may require substantial sampling effort to be effective. Genetic methods are a new and important sampling tool on the horizon, but obtaining sufficient DNA samples can be a challenge. 2. We evaluated the efficacy of using parasitic leeches Haemadipsa spp., as compared to camera trapping, to sample biodiversity. We collected 200 leeches from four forest patches in northeast Bangladesh, and identified recent vertebrate hosts using Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene extracted from each individual leech's blood meals. We then compared these data to species data from camera trapping conducted in the same forest patches. 3. Overall, 41.9\% of sequenced leeches contained amplifiable non-human mammal DNA. Four days of collecting leeches led to the identification of 12 species, compared to 26 species identified in 1,334 camera trap nights. 4. Synthesis and applications. After assessing the cost, effort and power of each technique, there are pros and cons to both camera trapping and leech blood meal analysis. Camera trapping and leech collection appear to be complementary approaches. When used together, they may provide a more complete monitoring tool for mammal biodiversity in tropical rainforests. Managers should consider adding leech collection to their biodiversity monitoring toolkit, as improved information will allow managers to create more effective conservation programmes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

However, little is known about whether inbreeding depression is also associated with differences in individual decision-making. For example, decisions about how many offspring to produce are often based upon the prevailing environmental conditions, such as resource availability, and getting these decisions wrong may have important fitness consequences for both parents and offspring. We tested for effects of inbreeding on individual decision-making in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, which uses the size of a carrion resource to make decisions about number of offspring. Both inbred and outbred females adjusted their initial decisions about number of eggs to lay based on carcass size. However, when we forced individuals to update this initial decision by providing them with a different-sized carcass partway through reproduction, inbred females failed to update their decision about how many larvae to cull. Consequently, inbred females reared too many larvae, resulting in negative fitness consequences in the form of smaller offspring and reduced female post-reproductive condition. Our study provides novel insights into the effects of inbreeding by showing that poor decision-making by inbred individuals can negatively affect fitness."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Their migrations include storied feats of endurance and physiology, from non-stop trans-Pacific crossings to flights at the cruising altitudes of jetliners. Despite intense interest in these performances, there remains great uncertainty about which factors most directly influence bird behaviour during migratory flights. We used GPS trackers that measure an individual's altitude and wingbeat frequency to track the migration of black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa) and identify the abiotic factors influencing their in-flight migratory behaviour. We found that godwits flew at altitudes above 5000 m during 21\% of all migratory flights, and reached maximum flight altitudes of nearly 6000 m. The partial pressure of oxygen at these altitudes is less than 50\% of that at sea level, yet these extremely high flights occurred in the absence of topographical barriers. Instead, they were associated with high air temperatures at lower altitudes and increasing wind support at higher altitudes. Our results therefore suggest that wind, temperature and topography all play a role in determining migratory behaviour, but that their relative importance is context dependent. Extremely high-altitude flights may thus not be especially rare, but they may only occur in very specific environmental contexts."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

All other extant great apes have a short tendon and long-fibred triceps surae, which is thought to be beneficial for locomotion in a complex arboreal habitat as this morphology enables a large range of motion. Surprisingly, highly arboreal gibbons show a more human-like triceps surae with a long Achilles tendon. Evidence for a spring-like function similar to humans is not conclusive. We revisit and integrate our anatomical and biomechanical data to calculate the energy that can be recovered from the recoiling Achilles tendon during ankle plantar flexion in bipedal gibbons. Only 7.5\% of the required external positive work in a stride can come from tendon recoil, yet it is delivered at an instant when the whole-body energy level drops. Consequently, an additional similar amount of mechanical energy must simultaneously dissipate elsewhere in the system. Altogether, this challenges the concept of an energy-saving function in the gibbon's Achilles tendon. Cercopithecids, sister group of the apes, also have a human-like triceps surae. Therefore, a well-developed Achilles tendon, present in the last common `Cercopithecoidea-Hominoidea' ancestor, seems plausible. If so, the gibbon's anatomy represents an evolutionary relict (no harm-no benefit), and the large Achilles tendon is not the premised key adaptation in humans (although the spring-like function may have further improved during evolution). Moreover, the triceps surae anatomy of extant non-human great apes must be a convergence, related to muscle control and range of motion. This perspective accords with the suggestions put forward in the literature that the last common hominoid ancestor was not necessarily great ape-like, but might have been more similar to the small-bodied catarrhines."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Salmon, by growing bear populations, have the potential to exert wide-ranging effects on ecosystem processes. Salmon-supported bears provide seed dispersal services to plants, and bear scats containing thousands of seeds may then be efficient nutritional resources for granivorous small mammals that also function as secondary seed dispersers while hoarding seeds for winter. We taxonomically identified and enumerated seeds in individual bear scats to characterize patterns of bear frugivory. We then combined estimates of seed abundance and digestible energy content to quantify the energy available to granivorous small mammals, and we quantified the proportion of the mouse population that could be supported by locally abundant bear populations in lowland salmon systems. We additionally monitored seed-filled bear scats with remote cameras to quantify small mammal visitation rates, and live-trapped small mammals seasonally to determine whether rodents visited bear scats proportional to their densities or whether some species preferentially selected for bear scats, and to assess whether seasonal variation in scat visitation was driven by density or selection. Bears were an important initial dispersal agent for 12 species of fruit, particularly devil's club (Oplopanax horridus) and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), which occurred in 80\% (5839 seeds/scat) and 50\% (10,719 seeds/scat) of scats, respectively. Seeds in bear scats were intensively utilized and dispersed by small mammals, primarily scatter-hoarding northwestern deer mice (Peromyscus keeni; 8.5 visits per day/4295 total visits) and larder-hoarding northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus; 2.2 visits per day/1099 total visits), with visitation rates proportional to the seasonal density of each species. Small mammals likely incurred significant nutritional benefits from seeds deposited in bear scats (kcal/scat, mean = 114, n = 71). In coastal Alaska riparian areas, bears are potentially capable of indirectly subsidizing the energy needs of 45-65\% of local deer mouse populations. Thus, this work helps elucidate the role that salmon, by supporting abundant bears, plays in ecological communities via influencing seed dispersal and resource subsidies to the small mammals that compose the base of the food web."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Offspring size is a key functional trait that can affect all phases of the life history, from birth to reproduction, and is common to all the Metazoa. Despite its ubiquity, reviews of this trait tend to be taxon-specific. We explored the causes and consequences of offspring size variation across plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. 2. We find that offspring size shows clear latitudinal patterns among species: fish, amphibians, invertebrates and birds show a positive covariation in offspring size with latitude; plants and turtles show a negative covariation with latitude. We highlight the developmental window hypothesis as an explanation for why plants and turtles show negative covariance with latitude. Meanwhile, we find evidence for stronger, positive selection on offspring size at higher latitudes for most animals. 3. Offspring size also varies at all scales of organization, from populations through to broods from the same female. We explore the reasons for this variation and suspect that much of this variation is adaptive, but in many cases, there are too few tests to generalize. 4. We show that larger offspring lose relatively less energy during development to independence such that larger offspring may have greater net energy budgets than smaller offspring. Larger offspring therefore enter the independent phase with relatively more energy reserves than smaller offspring. This may explain why larger offspring tend to outperform smaller offspring but more work on how offspring size affects energy acquisition is needed. 5. While life-history theorists have been fascinated by offspring size for over a century, key knowledge gaps remain. One important next step is to estimate the true energy costs of producing offspring of different sizes and numbers."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Mixed mating and variation in outcrossing rate among populations of the same species are common. Outcrossing can be affected by pollinator activity and floral traits that facilitate or impede autonomous self-fertilization. However, the relative contribution of pollen limitation and evolved differences in the ability to self-fertilize to variation in the mating system is poorly understood and can only be disentangled using an experimental approach. 2. We placed arrays of plants from eight Campanula americana populations that varied in autonomous selfing ability (hereafter autonomy) in sun and shade habitats to create high- and low-pollination environments. Floral visitors were observed and pollen limitation, dichogamy, herkogamy and pollen persistence within the flower were measured. Outcrossing rate was estimated for a subset of the arrays. 3. Pollen limitation was over three times higher in the shade than the sun due to differences in pollinator visitation. Populations with high levels of autonomy displayed greater pollen persistence and dichogamy in the more pollen-limited environments than in the high-pollination environments. In these high-autonomy populations, outcrossing rates were tightly associated with pollen limitation, with reduced outcrossing under strong pollen limitation. In contrast, populations with intermediate autonomy levels had less plastic floral traits and their outcrossing rates changed little with pollen limitation. 4. Mating system was shaped by both the pollination environment and the magnitude of plasticity in floral traits. The experimental approach used here revealed that plasticity in floral traits provides the ability to adjust mating system in response to limited potential for outcrossing. The lack of plasticity in some populations could explain mismatches between pollinator activity and mating system in natural populations. Finally, flexibility in the mating system may help explain the prevalence of mixed mating."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We conducted an experiment in a Chinese estuary to investigate the effects of a non-resource stress gradient, soil salinity (from 1.4 parts per thousand to 19.0 parts per thousand salinity), on the competitive interactions between native Phragmites australis and invasive Spartina alterniflora. We linked these effects to measurements of photosynthetic activities to further elucidate the underlying physiological mechanism behind the competitive interactions and the driver of invasion. The experiments revealed that while biomass of both species decreased in the presence of the other, competition did not alter photosynthetic activity of either species over time. P.australis exhibited high photosynthetic activity, including low chlorophyllase activity, high chlorophyll content, high stomatal conductance and high net photosynthetic rate, at low salinity. Under these conditions, P.australis experienced low competitive intensity, leading to high biomass production and competitive exclusion of S.alterniflora. The opposite was observed for S.alterniflora: while competitive intensity experienced by P.australis increased with increasing salinity, and photosynthetic activity, biomass, competitive dominance and the importance of competition for P.australis growth decreased, those of S.alterniflora were stable. These findings demonstrate that S.alterniflora invasion driven by competitive exclusion are likely to occur and expand in high salinity zones. The change in the nature of competition along a non-resource stress gradient differs between competitors likely due to differences in photosynthetic tolerance to salinity. The driver of growth of the less-tolerant species changes from competition to non-resource stress factors with increasing stress levels, whereas competition is constantly important for growth of the more-tolerant species. Incorporating metrics of both competition intensity and importance, as well as linking these competitive outcomes with physiological mechanisms, is crucial to understanding, predicting, and mediating the effects of invasive species in the future."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In occupancy studies, species misidentification can lead to false-positive detections, which can cause severe estimator biases. Currently, all models that account for false-positive errors only consider omnibus sources of false detections and are limited to single-species occupancy. 2. However, false detections for a given species often occur because of the misidentification with another, closely related species. To exploit this explicit source of false-positive detection error, we develop a two-species occupancy model that accounts for misidentifications between two species of interest. As with other false-positive models, identifiability is greatly improved by the availability of unambiguous detections at a subset of site x occasions. Here, we consider the case where some of the field observations can be confirmed using laboratory or other independent identification methods (confirmatory data). 3. We performed three simulation studies to (1) assess the model's performance under various realistic scenarios, (2) investigate the influence of the proportion of confirmatory data on estimator accuracy and (3) compare the performance of this two-species model with that of the single-species false-positive model. The model shows good performance under all scenarios, even when only small proportions of detections are confirmed (e.g. 5\%). It also clearly outperforms the single-species model. 4. We illustrate application of this model using a 4-year dataset on two sympatric species of lungless salamanders: the US federally endangered Shenandoah salamander Plethodon shenandoah, and its presumed competitor, the red-backed salamander Plethodon cinereus. Occupancy of red-backed salamanders appeared very stable across the 4 years of study, whereas the Shenandoah salamander displayed substantial turnover in occupancy of forest habitats among years. 5.

There are now many examples where ecological researchers used non-Euclidean distance metrics in geostatistical models that were designed for Euclidean distance, such as those used for kriging. This can lead to problems where predictions have negative variance estimates. Technically, this occurs because the spatial covariance matrix, which depends on the geostatistical models, is not guaranteed to be positive definite when non-Euclidean distance metrics are used. These are not permissible models, and should be avoided. 2. I give a quick review of kriging and illustrate the problem with several simulated examples, including locations on a circle, locations on a linear dichotomous network (such as might be used for streams), and locations on a linear trail or road network. I re-examine the linear network distance models from Ladle, Avgar, Wheatley, and Boyce (, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 8, 329) and show that they are not guaranteed to have a positive definite covariance matrix. 3. I introduce the reduced-rank method, also called a predictive-process model, for creating valid spatial covariance matrices with non-Euclidean distance metrics. It has an additional advantage of fast computation for large datasets. 4. I re-analysed the data of Ladle etal. (, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 8, 329), showing that fitted models that used linear network distance in geostatistical models, both with and without a nugget effect, had negative variances, poor predictive performance compared with reduced-rank methods, and had improper coverage for the prediction intervals. The reduced-rank approach using linear network distances provided a class of permissible models that had better predictive performance and proper coverage for the prediction intervals, and could be combined with Euclidean distance models to provide the best overall predictive performance."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Developing this comprehensive perspective is difficult though, because species interactions are complex, interdependent, and dynamic through space and time. Typically, experiments focus on tractable subsets of interactions that will be most critical to investigate and explain shifts in communities, but qualitatively base these choices on experience, natural history, and theory. One quantitative approach to identify the putative forces regulating communities, without reducing system complexity, is estimating transition probabilities among species occupying space (i.e., multispecies Markov chain models). Although not mechanistic, these models estimate the relative frequency and importance of ecological pathways in community assembly and dynamics, and can serve as a framework to identify how pathways change across large scales and which are most important to investigate further. Here, we demonstrate this method in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) intertidal zone, where research has largely focused on the local-scale processes that influence communities, while the mechanisms responsible for more regional shifts in communities are less clear. Transition probabilities of faunal elements were quantified bimonthly for similar to 2.5yr in local intertidal communities at three replicate sites in the southern, mid-coast, and northern GOM. Transitions related to mortality, colonization, and replacement by mussels, barnacles, red algae, and encrusting corallines differed regionally, suggesting specific pathways related to consumer pressure and recruitment vary across the GOM with shifting intertidal community structure. Combined with species abundance data and insights from previous research, we develop and evaluate the pathways by which communities likely change in the GOM. Species interactions in local communities can be complex, and this complexity should be incorporated into hypothesis building, experiments, theory, interpretations, and forecasts in ecology. Such a comprehensive approach will be critical to understand how regional shifts in local interactions can drive large-scale community change."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In addition, the sexes differ in their sensitivity to environmental factors during growth. This study evaluates how melanin plumage coloration varies in relation to sex and sunlight exposure in developing griffon vultures Gyps fulvus and how this correlates with survival. The results show that individuals grown in nests more exposed to sunlight developed paler plumages, as predicted by the thermal melanism hypothesis. In addition, paler malesbut not femaleshave lower survival probability. Finally, a significant sexual dichromatism in fledgling plumage was observed, with females being paler than males.

In this study, we use unprecedented comprehensive phylogenetic sampling of Anolis lizard species to examine comparative evolution in this well-studied adaptive radiation. We compare adaptive radiation models within Anolis and in the Anolis clade and a potential sister lineage, the Corytophanidae. We find evidence for island (i.e., opportunity) effects and no evidence for trait (i.e., key innovation) effects causing accelerated body size evolution within Anolis.

We find no evidence for an island effect on speciation rate and tenuous evidence for greater speciation rate due to trait effects. These results suggest the need for precision in treatments of classic adaptive radiations such as Anolis and further refinement of the concept of adaptive radiation."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

However, the question arises as to how cooperation was maintained after early humans transitioned to larger groups of unrelated individuals. We hypothesize that after cooperation had evolved via benefits to kin, the consecutive evolution of cognition increased the returns from cooperating, to the point where benefits to self were sufficient for cooperation to remain stable when group size increased and relatedness decreased. We investigate the theoretical plausibility of this hypothesis, with both analytical modelling and simulations. We examine situations where cognition either (i) increases the benefits of cooperation, (ii) leads to synergistic benefits between cognitively enhanced cooperators, (iii) allows the exploitation of less intelligent partners, and (iv) the combination of these effects. We find that cooperation and cognition can coevolve-cooperation initially evolves, favouring enhanced cognition, which favours enhanced cooperation, and stabilizes cooperation against a drop in relatedness. These results suggest that enhanced cognition could have transformed the nature of cooperative dilemmas faced by early humans, thereby explaining the maintenance of cooperation between unrelated partners."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

However, strong directional advection of water masses or retentive hydrodynamic forces can influence the degree of genetic exchange among marine populations. To determine the oceanographic drivers of genetic structure in a highly dispersive marine invertebrate, the giant California sea cucumber (Parastichopus californicus), we first tested for the presence of genetic discontinuities along the coast of North America in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Then, we tested two hypotheses regarding spatial processes influencing population structure: (i) isolation by distance (IBD: genetic structure is explained by geographic distance) and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR: genetic structure is driven by ocean circulation). Using RADseq, we genotyped 717 individuals from 24 sampling locations across 2,719 neutral SNPs to assess the degree of population differentiation and integrated estimates of genetic variation with inferred connectivity probabilities from a biophysical model of larval dispersal mediated by ocean currents. We identified two clusters separating north and south regions, as well as significant, albeit weak, substructure within regions (F-ST = 0.002, p = .001). After modelling the asymmetric nature of ocean currents, we demonstrated that local oceanography (IBR) was a better predictor of genetic variation (R-2 = .49) than geographic distance (IBD) (R-2 = .18), and directional processes played an important role in shaping fine-scale structure. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature identifying significant population structure in marine systems and has important implications for the spatial management of P.californicus and other exploited marine species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

However, there have been few attempts to empirically test the relationship between an animals' habitat use and performance. This is surprising, since knowing about this connection should enhance our ability to predict the local population dynamics of ecologically important species. Here, we used three primary experiments to assess the relationship between habitat use and performance for an important insect consumer (ladybeetles). First, we used field manipulations of resource availability (i.e., scale insects and cordgrass pollen) to examine the habitat use of ladybeetle predators. Second, we conducted a series of no-choice laboratory assays to compare the performance (fecundity and longevity) of ladybeetles on these different resources. Third, we quantified adult ladybeetle preference for olfactory cues from cordgrass with and without scale insects using a Y-tube olfactometer. In the field, adult ladybeetles selectively used plots containing scale insects. In the laboratory, diets containing scale insects maximized both adult and larval ladybeetle longevity, and adult fecundity. Adult ladybeetles were attracted to chemical cues associated with scale insects over distances of 10s of centimeters. Overall, our findings suggest that the habitat use and performance of ladybeetles are strongly linked, with ladybeetles preferentially using habitats that maximize their individual performance."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

While this is often computationally convenient, in particular when performing statistical inference in the presence of observation error, it may lead to unrealistic predictions for animals with a limited reproduction. We introduce a model that includes an explicit bound on the reproductive rate of an individual, and apply this to a population time series of ungulates in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Due to observational error, the year-to-year increases in animal counts occasionally exceeded the maximal reproductive rate of the animals. In such cases, the traditional unbounded model showed a tendency of overfitting data, leading to unrealistic predictions of the underlying population increase. An observed increase above the maximal reproductive rate also provides empirical confirmation that observation error exists. The model with an explicit bound was able to utilize this in order to separate observational error from population process noise, which the traditional unbounded model was unable to do. We conclude that enforcing a strict upper bound on the reproductive rate of an animal population model may lead to more realistic statistical inference than commonly applied log-linear models when an explicit bound on reproductive rate is known. We further conclude that introducing a bound on reproduction can greatly assist in separating observational error and population process noise for slow life histories, or more generally, when the rate of sampling is high compared to reproductive rates."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We predict that populations in warmer or wetter parts of a species' range should respond negatively to periods of above average temperature or precipitation, respectively, whereas populations in colder or drier areas should respond positively to periods of above average temperature or precipitation. To test this, we estimated the population sensitivity of a common shrub species, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), to annual climate variation across its range. Our analysis includes 8,175 observations of year-to-year change in sagebrush cover or production from 131 monitoring sites in western North America. We coupled these observations with seasonal weather data for each site and analyzed the effects of spring through fall temperatures and fall through spring accumulated precipitation on annual changes in sagebrush abundance. Sensitivity to annual temperature variation supported our hypothesis: years with above average temperatures were beneficial to sagebrush in colder locations and detrimental to sagebrush in hotter locations. In contrast, sensitivity to precipitation did not change significantly across the distribution of sagebrush. This pattern of responses suggests that regional abundance of this species may be more limited by temperature than by precipitation. We also found important differences in how the ecologically distinct subspecies of sagebrush responded to the effects of precipitation and temperature. Our model predicts that a short-term temperature increase could produce an increase in sagebrush cover at the cold edge of its range and a decrease in cover at the warm edge of its range. This prediction is qualitatively consistent with predictions from species distribution models for sagebrush based on spatial occurrence data, but it provides new mechanistic insight and helps estimate how much and how fast sagebrush cover may change within its range."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

We modeled two types of MEs: (i) an environmentally plastic ME, in which the relationship between maternal and offspring clutch size depended on the maternal environment via offspring condition, and (ii) a fixed ME, in which this relationship was constant. Although both types of ME affected the rate of adaptation following an abrupt environmental shift, the overall effects were small. We conclude that evolutionary consequences of MEs are modest at best in our study system, at least for the trait and the particular type of ME we considered here.

Quantifying the relationship between tree diameter and height is a key component of efforts to estimate biomass and carbon stocks in tropical forests. Although substantial site-to-site variation in height-diameter allometries has been documented, the time consuming nature of measuring all tree heights in an inventory plot means that most studies do not include height, or else use generic pan-tropical or regional allometric equations to estimate height. 2. Using a pan-tropical dataset of 73 plots where at least 150 trees had in-field ground-based height measurements, we examined how the number of trees sampled affects the performance of locally derived height-diameter allometries, and evaluated the performance of different methods for sampling trees for height measurement. 3. Using cross-validation, we found that allometries constructed with just 20 locally measured values could often predict tree height with lower error than regional or climate-based allometries (mean reduction in prediction error = 0.46 m). The predictive performance of locally derived allometries improved with sample size, but with diminishing returns in performance gains when more than 40 trees were sampled. Estimates of stand-level biomass produced using local allometries to estimate tree height show no over- or under-estimation bias when compared with biomass estimates using field measured heights. We evaluated five strategies to sample trees for height measurement, and found that sampling strategies that included measuring the heights of the ten largest diameter trees in a plot outperformed (in terms of-resulting in local height-diameter models with low height prediction error) entirely random or diameter size-class stratified approaches. 4. Our results indicate that even limited sampling of heights can be used to refine height-diameter allometries. We recommend aiming for a conservative threshold of sampling 50 trees per location for height measurement, and including the ten trees with the largest diameter in this sample."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

However, because of the difficulty of collecting pedigree and life-history data from wild populations, relatively few studies have been able to compare inbreeding depression for traits at different points in the life cycle. Moreover, pedigrees give the expected proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBDg) whereas in theory with enough molecular markers realized IBDg can be quantified directly. We therefore investigated inbreeding depression for multiple life-history traits in a wild population of banded mongooses using pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients (f(ped)) and standardized multilocus heterozygosity (sMLH) measured at 35-43 microsatellites. Within an information theoretic framework, we evaluated support for either f(ped) or sMLH as inbreeding terms and used sequential regression to determine whether the residuals of sMLH on f(ped) explain fitness variation above and beyond f(ped). We found no evidence of inbreeding depression for survival, either before or after nutritional independence. By contrast, inbreeding was negatively associated with two quality-related traits, yearling body mass and annual male reproductive success. Yearling body mass was associated with f(ped) but not sMLH, while male annual reproductive success was best explained by both f(ped) and residual sMLH. Thus, our study not only uncovers variation in the extent to which different traits show inbreeding depression, but also reveals trait-specific differences in the ability of pedigrees and molecular markers to explain fitness variation and suggests that for certain traits, genetic markers may capture variation in realized IBDg above and beyond the pedigree expectation."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In addition to the full data set, a set of geographical and statistical subsets was created, allowing each method to be tested on multiple data sets with different characteristics. The predictions of the models were tested against the true species-area relationship for British plants, derived from contemporaneously surveyed national atlas data. This represents a far more ambitious test than is usually employed, requiring 5-10 orders of magnitude in upscaling. The methods differed greatly in their performance; while there are 2,326 focal plant taxa recorded in the focal region, up-scaled species richness estimates ranged from 62 to 11,593. Several models provided reasonably reliable results across the 16 test data sets: the Shen and He and the Ulrich and Ollik models provided the most robust estimates of total species richness, with the former generally providing estimates within 10\% of the true value. The methods tested proved less accurate at estimating the shape of the species-area relationship (SAR) as a whole; the best single method was Hui's Occupancy Rank Curve approach, which erred on average by {\textless}20\%. A hybrid method combining a total species richness estimate (from the Shen and He model) with a downscaling approach (the Sizling model) proved more accurate in predicting the SAR (mean relative error 15.5\%) than any of the pure upscaling approaches tested. There remains substantial room for improvement in upscaling methods, but our results suggest that several existing methods have a high potential for practical application to estimating species richness at coarse spatial scales.

Theoretically, competition between species with overlapping niches should result in divergence of their niches in sympatry to reduce the costs of competition. Many species show a mosaic distribution within sympatric zones, with the syntopic sites occupied by both species, and allotopic sites where only one species occurs. It is unclear whether such mosaics arise as a consequence of competition-driven niche segregation or due to the decline of their abundances towards range edges driven by environmental gradients. 2. If the interspecific competition matters, we should observe (1) a shift in habitat preferences of one or both species between syntopy and allotopy, and (2) between allopatry and allotopy. Moreover, (3) species should show greater divergence in their habitat preferences in allotopy than in allopatry where (4) no differences in habitat preferences may occur. Finally, (5) shifts should be generally greater in the competitively subordinate species than in the dominant species. 3. We used a unique dataset on abundance of two closely related passerine species, the Common Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and the Thrush Nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), collected across their syntopy, allotopy and allopatry. The predictions were tested within a generalized mixed-effects modelling framework. 4. After accounting for environmental gradients perpendicular to the species' contact zone, we found a strong support for all but one prediction. Habitat preferences of both species shifted markedly between syntopy and allotopy, as well as between allopatry and allotopy. Whereas the species preferred the same habitats in allopatry, their preferences became strikingly different in allotopy where the abundance of the Common Nightingale increased towards dry and warm sites with low coverage of pastures, while the abundance of the Thrush Nightingale showed exactly opposite trends. Fifth prediction was not supported. 5. Our results indicate that the competition between closely related species can result in considerable changes in habitat use across their geographic ranges accompanied with divergence in their habitat preferences in sympatry. Here, the species escape from competition to allotopic sites covered by habitats avoided by the competitor. Therefore, we argue that the interspecific competition is an important driver of species' distribution at both large and small spatial scales."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Determining how species coexist is critical for understanding functional diversity, niche partitioning and interspecific interactions. Identifying the direct and indirect interactions among sympatric carnivores that enable their coexistence is particularly important to elucidate because they are integral for maintaining ecosystem function. 2. We studied the effects of removing nine fishers (Pekania pennanti) on their population dynamics and used this perturbation to elucidate the interspecific interactions among fishers, grey foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and ringtails (Bassariscus astutus). Grey foxes (family: Canidae) are likely to compete with fishers due to their similar body sizes and dietary overlap, and ringtails (family: Procyonidae), like fishers, are semi-arboreal species of conservation concern. We used spatial capture-recapture to investigate fisher population numbers and dynamic occupancy models that incorporated interspecific interactions to investigate the effects members of these species had on the colonization and persistence of each other's site occupancy. 3. The fisher population showed no change in density for up to 3 years following the removals of fishers for translocations. In contrast, fisher site occupancy decreased in the years immediately following the translocations. During this same time period, site occupancy by grey foxes increased and remained elevated through the end of the study. 4. We found a complicated hierarchy among fishers, foxes and ringtails. Fishers affected grey fox site persistence negatively but had a positive effect on their colonization. Foxes had a positive effect on ringtail site colonization. Thus, fishers were the dominant small carnivore where present and negatively affected foxes directly and ringtails indirectly. 5. Coexistence among the small carnivores we studied appears to reflect dynamic spatial partitioning. Conservation and management efforts should investigate how intraguild interactions may influence the recolonization of carnivores to previously occupied landscapes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Multiple-scale foraging decisions by large herbivores can cause associational effects of focal plant individuals neighboured with different species. Spatial micropatterns between the focal plant and its neighbouring species within patches can affect herbivore foraging selectivity at within-and between-patch scales, which may consequently lead to associational plant effects occurring at both plant individual and population levels. However, these associational effects have not been explored together in the plant-herbivore interaction studies. 2. We aim to evaluate how plant spatial micro-pattern within different quality patches mediate herbivore foraging selectivity, thereby affecting the associational effects of focal plant individuals and population. 3. Using sheep as the model herbivore and a medium preferred species as the focal plant, we conducted a manipulative experiment by allowing sheep grazing freely among three different quality patches, each of which consisted of preferred, unpreferred and focal plant species with different abundances forming spatially aggregated or dispersed micro-patterns. 4. Results showed that, compared with the aggregated plant micro-pattern, dispersed plant micro-patterns within different quality patches increased sheep within-patch selectivity, and caused diverse associational effects of focal plant individuals. Focal plant individuals experienced neighbour contrast defence (i.e. got protection in the high quality patch) and associational defence (i.e. got protection in the low quality patch), respectively, when plants distributed dispersedly in the low and high quality patch. Focal plant individuals simultaneously experienced associational susceptibility (i.e. got damage in the high quality patch) and neighbour contrast susceptibility (i.e. got damage in the low quality patch) when plants distributed dispersedly in the medium quality patch. Furthermore, dispersed plant micro-patterns reduced sheep foraging selectivity between patches, and led to a lower consumption of focal plant population compared with the aggregated plant micro-pattern. 5. Herbivores adopt different within-and between-patch foraging decisions to maintain a high intake of the preferred species in response to various plant micro-patterns, and consequently cause diverse associational effects of both focal plant individuals and population. These associational effects have important implications for understanding the species coexistence and plant community assembly in the grazing ecosystems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Habitat loss is the primary cause of local extinctions. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how fast species respond to habitat loss, and how time-delayed responses vary in space. 2. We focused on the Argentine Dry Chaco (c. 32 million ha), a global deforestation hotspot, and tested for time-delayed response of bird and mammal communities to landscape transformation. We quantified the magnitude of extinction debt by modelling contemporary species richness as a function of either contemporary or past (2000 and 1985) landscape patterns. We then used these models to map communities' extinction debt. 3. We found strong evidence for an extinction debt: landscape structure from 2000 explained contemporary species richness of birds and mammals better than contemporary and 1985 landscapes. This suggests time-delayed responses between 10 and 25 years. Extinction debt was especially strong for forest specialists. 4. Projecting our models across the Chaco highlighted areas where future local extinctions due to unpaid extinction debt are likely. Areas recently converted to agriculture had highest extinction debt, regardless of the post-conversion land use. Few local extinctions were predicted in areas with remaining larger forest patches. 5. Synthesis and applications. The evidence for an unpaid extinction debt in the Argentine Dry Chaco provides a substantial window of opportunity for averting local biodiversity losses. However, this window may close rapidly if conservation activities such as habitat restoration are not implemented swiftly. Our extinction debt maps highlight areas where such conservation activities should be implemented."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Invasive forest pathogens of the genus Phytophthora are threatening ecosystems globally. Phytophthora species are mainly introduced by humans importing infected nursery stock. However, due to the presence of environmental filters, not all introduced Phytophthoras manage to establish and spread. Phytophthoras' ability to overcome these filters may be linked to functional traits. In northern Europe, the increasing number of reports calls for a better understanding of the invasion process to prevent future outbreaks. 2. We hypothesized that the incidence of invasive Phytophthoras in urban locations would be higher than in remote forests, that there would be a decrease of species richness along the invasion process because of environmental filtering, and that there would be a functional shift among Phytophthora communities between stages of invasion. We compared the species composition of 96 sites from 16 rivers running through areas that constitute a gradient of human influence. We also compared the species composition and functional diversity of Phytophthora communities in eight nurseries and 14 forests, including anthropogenic and natural forests. Phytophthoras were isolated from river water, soil and/or plant tissue. Cultures were identified based on the Internal Transcribed Spacer region. 3. Three Phytophthoras were detected in all environments (Phytophthora cactorum, Phytophthora plurivora and Phytophthora cambivora). The incidence of these species was higher in urban locations than in remote forests, suggesting that human activities act as a driver of invasion. Most of the Phytophthoras detected in forests were detected in nurseries. The Phytophthora community in nurseries was richer and more diverse than in forests, pointing to environmental filtering affecting the establishment. Phytophthora communities in nurseries and forests differed in their functional divergence. Traits associated with establishment were the ability to form asexual survival structures and lower cardinal temperatures for growth. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings support the view that human activities act as drivers of Phytophthora invasions, and suggest that Phytophthoras able to form asexual structures are more likely to establish in northern Europe. The results increase the capacity to predict the establishment of Phytophthora species in Sweden and expand our understanding of the invasion process of forest pathogens."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Allen month = may,",10.1111/1365-2664.13054,,,,"1. Although pollution is a major driver of ecosystem change, models predicting the environmental fate of contaminants suffer from critical uncertainties related to oversimplifying the dynamics of the biological compartment. 2. It is increasingly recognized that contaminant processing is an outcome of ecosystem functioning, that ecosystem functioning is contingent on community structure and that community structure is influenced by organismal dispersal. We propose a conceptual organization of the contribution of organismal dispersal to local contaminant fate. Direct dispersal effects occur when the dispersing organism directly couples contaminant stocks in spatially separate ecosystems by transporting contaminants in its biomass. Indirect dispersal effects occur when the dispersing organism indirectly influences contaminant fate via community assembly. This can occur either when the dispersing organism is a contaminant processor or when the dispersing organism alters, via species interactions, the abundance of contaminant biotransporters or processors already established in the ecosystem. The magnitude of direct and indirect dispersal effects is modulated by many factors, including other contaminants. These will influence population growth rates of the dispersing species in the donor ecosystem, or the probability that a dispersing individual reaches the recipient ecosystem. 3. We provide a review of pertinent literature demonstrating that these two mechanisms, and their chemical modulation, are well supported or likely to occur in many natural and human-modified landscapes. The literature also demonstrates that they can operate in concert with each other. 4. Synthesis and applications. Managed ecosystems thought to be important contaminant and nutrient sinks, such as artificial ponds and constructed wetlands, should be monitored and controlled for in-and-out animal movement if contaminant export is found to be relevant. Uncontaminated fishing grounds linked to contaminated sites via movement of dispersing species should be monitored and resident species evaluated for health consumption advisories. Assessing the success of contaminated site remediation can be improved by better matching the spatial extent of site remediation and the home range of monitored species. Finally, interagency research fund programmes should be developed that narrow the current gap between the fields of ecology and ecotoxicology."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review"

Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spatial spread. Potential reasons for this include: (i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; (ii) higher incidence of long-range dispersal; and (iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential factors using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We detected a small but significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected a pair of putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312 m apart, indicating long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. We also found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, indicating intergenerational loss of Wolbachia in the field. These three factors are all expected to contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through Ae. aegypti populations, though from our results it is unclear whether Wolbachia loss and long-distance movement are sufficiently common to reduce the speed of spatial spread appreciably. Our findings inform the strategic deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes during releases, and show how parameter estimates from laboratory studies may differ from those estimated using field data. Our landscape genomics approach can be extended to other host/symbiont systems that are being considered for biocontrol."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Here, we demonstrate that a nuclear suppressor of a cytoplasmic male killer has spread rapidly in a population of the green lacewing Mallada desjardinsi. An M. desjardinsi population, which was strongly female-biased in 2011 because of a high prevalence of the male-killing Spiroplasma endosymbiont, had a sex ratio near parity in 2016, despite a consistent Spiroplasma prevalence. Most of the offspring derived from individuals collected in 2016 had 1 : 1 sex ratios in subsequent generations. Contrastingly, all-female or female-biased broods appeared frequently from crossings of these female offspring with males derived from a laboratory line founded by individuals collected in 2011. These results suggest near-fixation of a nuclear suppressor against male killing in 2016 and reject the notion that a non-male-killing Spiroplasma variant has spread in the population. Consistently, no significant difference was detected in mitochondrial haplotype variation between 2011 and 2016. These findings, and earlier findings in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina in Samoa, suggest that these quick events of male recovery occur more commonly than is generally appreciated."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

These changes can involve a mis-timing between periods of high food demand and peak food availability, typically from advances in breeding phenology, and/or an overall reduction in food availability. Aerial insectivores, birds that feed on insects caught in flight, are experiencing steep population declines possibly because of shifts in the timing and/or abundance of aerial insects. We determined whether changes in breeding performance over time could account for declines in Bank Riparia riparia, Barn Hirundo rustica, Cliff Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, and Tree Tachycineta bicolor Swallows, and if so, whether changes were related to shifts in breeding phenology and/or climate change. We compared breeding performance and phenology in Maritime Canada before (1962-1972) and after (2006-2016) the onset of steep population declines during the mid-1980s, to determine whether breeding performance was reduced or phenology was advanced. Then, we modeled relationships between temperature, precipitation, breeding phenology, and performance for Barn and Tree Swallows, the only species with sufficient data, from 1960 to 2016, to determine whether phenology and performance were related to climatic conditions. Between the two time periods, we found significantly lower performance in Bank Swallows, higher performance in Barn and Tree Swallows, and unchanged performance in Cliff Swallows. We also found clutch initiation dates advanced by 8-10 d for all species except Bank Swallows. On the breeding grounds, warmer winter temperatures for Tree Swallows and less winter precipitation for Barn and Tree Swallows in a given year were associated with earlier breeding, and for Tree Swallows, changes in nestling survival. Otherwise, Barn and Tree Swallow breeding performance was unaffected by winter temperature and precipitation. Our results suggest that in this region poorer breeding performance could contribute to population declines for Bank Swallows but not for the other three species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Nematode worms are ubiquitous across most habitats on earth, yet little is known about host-associated microbial assemblages within the phylum. Free-living nematodes are globally abundant and diverse in marine sediments, with species exhibiting distinct buccal cavity (mouth) morphologies that are thought to play an important role in feeding ecology and life history strategies. Here, we investigated patterns in marine nematode microbiomes, by characterizing host-associated microbial taxa in 281 worms isolated from a range of habitat types (deep-sea, shallow water, methane seeps, Lophelia coral mounds, kelp holdfasts) across three distinct geographic regions (Arctic, Southern California and Gulf of Mexico). Microbiome profiles were generated from single worms spanning 33 distinct morphological genera, using a two-gene metabarcoding approach to amplify the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene targeting bacteria/archaea and the V1-V2 region of the 18S rRNA gene targeting microbial eukaryotes. Contrary to our expectations, nematode microbiome profiles demonstrated no distinct patterns either globally (across depths and ocean basins) or locally (within site); prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial assemblages did not correlate with nematode feeding morphology, host phylogeny or morphological identity, ocean region or marine habitat type. However, fine-scale analysis of nematode microbiomes revealed a variety of novel ecological interactions, including putative parasites and symbionts, and potential associations with bacterial/archaeal taxa involved in nitrogen and methane cycling. Our results suggest that in marine habitats, free-living nematodes may utilize diverse and generalist foraging strategies that are not correlated with host genotype or feeding morphology. Furthermore, some abiotic factors such as geographic region and habitat type do not appear to play an obvious role in structuring host-microbe associations or feeding preferences."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

The paradigm that reduced genetic diversity should limit the evolutionary potential of invasive species, and thus, their potential for range expansion has received little empirical support, possibly due to the choice of genetic markers. Our goal was to test for effects of genetic drift and selection at functional genetic markers as they relate to the invasion success of two paired invasive goby species, one widespread (successful) and one with limited range expansion (less successful). We genotyped fish using two marker types: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in known-function, protein-coding genes and microsatellites to contrast the effects of neutral genetic processes. We identified reduced allelic variation in the invaded range for the less successful tubenose goby. SNPs putatively under selection were responsible for the observed differences in population structure between marker types for round goby (successful) but not tubenose goby (less successful). A higher proportion of functional loci experienced divergent selection for round goby, suggesting increased evolutionary potential in invaded ranges may be associated with round goby's greater invasion success. Genes involved in thermal tolerance were divergent for round goby populations but not tubenose goby, consistent with the hypothesis that invasion success for fish in temperate regions is influenced by capacity for thermal tolerance. Our results highlight the need to incorporate functional genetic markers in studies to better assess evolutionary potential for the improved conservation and management of species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

The investigation of genetic clusters in natural populations is an ubiquitous problem in a range of fields relying on the analysis of genetic data, such as molecular ecology, conservation biology and microbiology. Typically, genetic clusters are defined as distinct panmictic populations, or parental groups in the context of hybridisation. Two types of methods have been developed for identifying such clusters: model-based methods, which are usually computer-intensive but yield results which can be interpreted in the light of an explicit population genetic model, and geometric approaches, which are less interpretable but remarkably faster. 2. Here, we introduce snapclust, a fast maximum-likelihood solution to the genetic clustering problem, which allies the advantages of both model-based and geometric approaches. Our method relies on maximising the likelihood of a fixed number of panmictic populations, using a combination of geometric approach and fast likelihood optimisation, using the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. It can be used for assigning genotypes to populations and optionally identify various types of hybrids between two parental populations. Several goodness-of-fit statistics can also be used to guide the choice of the retained number of clusters. 3. Using extensive simulations, we show that snapclust performs comparably to current gold standards for genetic clustering as well as hybrid detection, with some advantages for identifying hybrids after several backcrosses, while being orders of magnitude faster than other model-based methods. We also illustrate how snapclust can be used for identifying the optimal number of clusters, and subsequently assign individuals to various hybrid classes simulated from an empirical microsatellite dataset. 4. snapclust is implemented in the package adegenet for the free software R, and is therefore easily integrated into existing pipelines for genetic data analysis. It can be applied to any kind of co-dominant markers, and can easily be extended to more complex models including, for instance, varying ploidy levels. Given its flexibility and computer-efficiency, it provides a useful complement to the existing toolbox for the study of genetic diversity in natural populations."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Plant roots and the associated mycorrhizal fungal hyphae often selectively proliferate into patchily distributed soil nutrient hotspots, but interactions between these two components of a mycorrhizal root system are usually ignored or experimentally isolated in nutrient foraging studies. 2. From studies in which both roots and mycorrhizal hyphae had access to nutrient hotspots, we compiled data on root foraging precision (increase in roots in nutrient hotspots relative to outside hotspots) of plant species from different ecosystems, ranging from temperate grasslands to subtropical forests. We found that root foraging precision across the wide range of plant species was strongly influenced by root morphology and mycorrhizal type. 3. The precision of root nutrient foraging, as a plant functional trait, may coordinate with other root traits that are related to the economics of nutrient acquisition. High foraging precision is expected to associate with the strategy of fast return on the investment in roots, such as low construction cost, high metabolic rate and rapid turnover. 4. Nutrient foraging by mycorrhizal fungi alone may be influenced by functional traits such as hyphal exploration distance, hyphal turnover, and hyphal uptake capacity and efficiency, but such data are limited to a small portion of mycorrhizal fungal species. 5. We propose a conceptual framework in which to simulate nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition from both nutrient hotspots and outside hotspots in mixed-species plant communities. Simulation outputs suggest that plant species with varying root morphology and mycorrhizal type can be adaptive to a range of nutrient heterogeneity. 6. Although there are still knowledge gaps related to nutrient foraging, as well as many unexplored plant and fungal species, we suggest that scaling nutrient foraging from individual plants to communities would advance understanding of plant species interactions and below-ground ecosystem function."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

In natural communities, however, other antagonists and symbionts moderate competition. Thus, we have to go beyond studying pairwise interactions. Natural enemies may facilitate coexistence if they affect the superior competitor more strongly, or they can hinder coexistence via apparent competition. Less well studied is the role of symbionts, which may influence species coexistence in conjunction with enemies. Eukaryotes commonly harbour microbial endosymbionts that provide protection against natural enemies, but are costly in their absence. Such defensive symbionts could thus mediate coexistence of species competing for the same resource, both in the presence and in the absence of enemies, but as yet there is little evidence for this claim. We addressed this proposed role of defensive symbionts in replicated simple communities consisting of two aphid species sharing the same host plant and the same natural enemy, a parasitoid wasp. Both, one, or neither species were infected with a resistance-conferring symbiont, and they competed in the absence as well as the presence of parasitoids. The symbiont had significant effects in the absence of parasitoids by lowering competitive ability especially in one species, but the effects were more dramatic in the presence of parasitoids. With both species protected by the symbiont, parasitoid densities remained low and both aphid species persisted. When neither species was protected, parasitoids drove both species to extinction. Surprisingly, the same outcome was observed when only one species was protected. The susceptible species supported high densities of parasitoids that also killed the resistant aphids via mechanisms other than parasitism, presumably by disturbing them to the point of starvation. This is an intriguing form of apparent competition. Our results demonstrate an important role of defensive symbionts in insect communities through modifying species interactions.

Studies have tested stress tolerance and competitive ability in mediating interaction outcomes, but few have incorporated this to predict how species interactions shift between competition and facilitation along stress gradients. We used field surveys, salt tolerance and competition experiments to develop a predictive model interspecific interaction shifts across salinity stress gradients. Field survey and greenhouse tolerance tests revealed tradeoffs between stress tolerance and competitive ability. Modeling showed that along salinity gradients, (1) plant interactions shifted from competition to facilitation at high salinities within the physiological limits of salt-intolerant plants, (2) facilitation collapsed when salinity stress exceeded the physiological tolerance of salt-intolerant plants, and (3) neighbor removal experiments overestimate interspecific facilitation by including intraspecific effects. A community-level field experiment, suggested that (1) species interactions are competitive in benign and, facilitative in harsh condition, but fuzzy under medium environmental stress due to niche differences of species and weak stress amelioration, and (2) the SGH works on strong but not weak stress gradients, so SGH confusion arises when it is applied across questionable stress gradients. Our study clarifies how species interactions vary along stress gradients. Moving forward, focusing on SGH applications rather than exceptions on weak or nonexistent gradients would be most productive."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Majority of these livestock species, including goats, are of non-descript and uncharacterized breeds and their response to natural selection presented by heterogeneous environments is still unresolved. This study investigated genetic diversity and its association with environmental and geographic conditions in 194 South African indigenous goats from different geographic locations genotyped on the Illumina goat SNP50K panel. Population structure analysis revealed a homogeneous genetic cluster of the Tankwa goats, restricted to the Northern Cape province. Overall, the Boer, Kalahari Red, and Savanna showed a wide geographic spread of shared genetic components, whereas the village ecotypes revealed a longitudinal distribution. The relative importance of environmental factors on genetic variation of goat populations was assessed using redundancy analysis (RDA). Climatic and geographic variables explained 22\% of the total variation while climatic variables alone accounted for 17\% of the diversity. Geographic variables solitarily explained 1\% of the total variation. The first axis (Model I) of the RDA analysis revealed 329 outlier SNPs. Landscape genomic approaches of spatial analysis method (SAM) identified a total of 843 (1.75\%) SNPs, while latent factor mixed models (LFMM) identified 714 (1.48\%) SNPs significantly associated with environmental variables. Significant markers were within genes involved in biological functions potentially important for environmental adaptation. Overall, the study suggested environmental factors to have some effect in shaping the genetic variation of South African indigenous goat populations. Loci observed to be significant and under selection may be responsible for the adaption of the goat populations to local production systems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Taking advantage of three coral restoration nurseries in Florida that serve as long-term common garden experiments, we exposed over 30 genetically distinct Acropora cervicornis colonies to hot and cold temperature shocks seasonally and measured pooled gene expression responses using RNAseq. Targeting a subset of 20 genes, we designed a high-throughput qPCR array to quantify expression in all individuals separately under each treatment with the goal of identifying predictive and/or diagnostic thermal stress biomarkers. We observed extensive transcriptional variation in the population, suggesting abundant raw material is available for adaptation via natural selection.

Here, we review 66 empirical studies that use Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in OA and EAA. We report trends and biases across biological systems, sequencing methods, approaches, parameters, environmental variables and their influence on detecting signatures of selection. We found striking variability in both the use and reporting of environmental data and statistical parameters. For example, linkage disequilibrium among SNPs and numbers of unique SNP associations identified with EAA were rarely reported. The proportion of putatively adaptive SNPs detected varied widely among studies, and decreased with the number of SNPs analysed. We found that genomic sampling effort had a greater impact than biological sampling effort on the proportion of identified SNPs under selection. OA identified a higher proportion of outliers when more individuals were sampled, but this was not the case for EAA. To facilitate repeatability, interpretation and synthesis of studies detecting selection, we recommend that future studies consistently report geographical coordinates, environmental data, model parameters, linkage disequilibrium, and measures of genetic structure.

Using landscape genetic approaches, we combined study area replication and multiscale analysis to determine how landscape composition, configuration and connectivity influence snail dispersal across urban areas. At the overall landscape scale, areas with a high percentage of roads decreased genetic differentiation between populations. At the population scale, genetic differentiation was positively linked with building surface, the proportion of borders where wooded patches and roads appeared side by side and the proportion of borders combining wooded patches and other impervious areas. Analyses based on pairwise genetic distances validated the isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-resistance models for this land snail, with an equal fit to least-cost paths and circuit-theory-based models. Each of the 12 landscapes analysed separately yielded specific relations to environmental features, whereas analyses integrating all replicates highlighted general common effects. Our results suggest that urban transport infrastructures facilitate passive snail dispersal. At a local scale, corresponding to active dispersal, unfavourable habitats (wooded and impervious areas) isolate populations. This work upholds the use of replicated landscapes to increase the generalizability of landscape genetics results and shows how multiscale analyses provide insight into scale-dependent processes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Some authors have suggested that condition-transfer effects result simply from resource limitation constraints (passive condition transfer, or transmissive effects). However, condition transfer can also reflect evolved parental investment strategies (active condition-transfer effects). In some species, such strategies can involve cryptic mechanisms such as epigenetic inheritance. As recently shown in this journal by Engqvist and Reinhold, condition-transfer effects can be obscured by anticipatory effects and interactions between the effects of parental and offspring environments. Nonetheless, we argue that these complications can be largely overcome by examining a broad range of ecologically relevant environments in both parental and offspring generations. This can be accomplished by adapting a powerful methodology from the nutritional sciencesthe geometric frameworkto research on parental effects."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: perspective"

Although the majority of the terrestrial biodiversity is hidden in soils, very little is known about the importance of the diversity of microbial communities for soil functioning. Here, we tested effects of biodiversity on the functioning of methanotrophs, a specialized group of soil bacteria that plays a key role in mediating greenhouse gas emissions from soils. Using pure strains of methanotrophic bacteria, we assembled artificial communities of different diversity levels, with which we inoculated sterile soil microcosms. To assess the functioning of these communities, we measured methane oxidation by gas chromatography throughout the experiment and determined changes in community composition and community size at several time points by quantitative PCR and sequencing. We demonstrate that microbial diversity had a positive overyielding effect on methane oxidation, in particular at the beginning of the experiment. This higher assimilation of CH4 at high diversity translated into increased growth and significantly larger communities towards the end of the study. The overyielding of mixtures with respect to CH4 consumption and community size were positively correlated. The temporal CH4 consumption profiles of strain monocultures differed, raising the possibility that temporal complementarity of component strains drove the observed community-level strain richness effects; however, the community niche metric we derived from the temporal activity profiles did not explain the observed strain richness effect. The strain richness effect also was unrelated to both the phylogenetic and functional trait diversity of mixed communities. Overall, our results suggest that positive biodiversity-ecosystem-function relationships show similar patterns across different scales and may be widespread in nature. Additionally, biodiversity is probably also important in natural methanotrophic communities for the ecosystem function methane oxidation. Therefore, maintaining soil conditions that support a high diversity of methanotrophs may help to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas methane."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

First, genome size was quantified in 65 species and mapped onto a novel fossil-calibrated phylogeny. Two evolution ary shifts in genome size were identified across the tree-the first between 43 and 49 Ma (95\% highest posterior density (HPD) 36.2-68.1 Ma) and the second at approximately 19 Ma (95\% HPD 15.3-30.14 Ma). Second, restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing was used to identify potential WGD events and quantify transposable element (TE) abundance in different lineages. Evidence of two lineage-scale WGDs was identified across the phylogeny, the first event occurring between 54 and 66 Ma (95\% HPD 42.56-99.5 Ma) and the second at 20-30 Ma (95\% HPD 15.3-45 Ma) based on haplotype numbers per contig and between 35 and 44 Ma (95\% HPD 30.29-64.51 Ma) and 20-30 Ma (95\% HPD 15.3-45 Ma) based on SNP read ratios.

Remarkably, field observations of killer whales have documented the existence of group-differentiated vocal dialects that are often referred to as traditions or cultures and are hypothesized to be acquired non-genetically. Here we use a do-as-I-do paradigm to study the abilities of a killer whale to imitate novel sounds uttered by conspecific (vocal imitative learning) and human models (vocal mimicry).

Namapoikia formed laminar or domal morphologies with an internal structure of open tubules and transverse elements, and had a very plastic, non-deterministic growth form which could encrust both fully lithified surfaces as well as living microbial substrates, the latter via modified skeletal holdfasts. Namapoikia shows complex growth interactions and substrate competition with contemporary living microbialites and thrombolites, including the production of plate-like dissepiments in response to microbial overgrowth which served to elevate soft tissue above the microbial surface. Namapoikia could also recover from partial mortality due to microbial fouling. We infer initial skeletal growth to have propagated via the rapid formation of an organic scaffold via a basal pinacoderm prior to calcification. This is likely an ancient mode of biomineralization with similarities to the living calcified demosponge Vaceletia. Namapoikia also shows inferred skeletal growth banding which, combined with its large size, implies notable individual longevity. In sum, Namapoikia was a large, relatively long-lived Ediacaran clonal skeletal metazoan that propagated via an organic scaffold prior to calcification, enabling rapid, effective and dynamic substrate occupation and competition in cryptic reef settings. The open tubular internal structure, highly flexible, non-deterministic skeletal organization, and inferred style of biomineralization of Namapoikia places probable affinity within total-group poriferans."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Explaining how reproductive isolation proceeds from the initiation of divergence to the complete prevention of mating is often a difficult task, as the underlying genes for traits associated with reproductive isolation can change via molecular evolution and subsequent protein coding alterations or through alterations of gene expression regulation. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Treer, Maex, VanBocxlaer, Proost, and Bossuyt (2017) use transcriptomic, proteomic and phylogenetic analyses to show that species-specific sex pheromones are the result of gradual sequence divergence on the same set of proteins in two closely related newt species (Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton helveticus). This study shows that salamander pheromone systems provide an enticing opportunity to connect the evolution of reproductive isolation to the changes in genes that underlie a key phenotype."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: perspective"

We examined Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) den use by lemmings, their primary prey, in winter during a year of low lemming densities. We found winter nests, which are built by lemmings under snow, on 69\% of fox dens, whereas no control sites had nests. In August, dens had twice the vegetation cover and 50\% greater nitrogen content in grass than controls, suggesting soil enrichment by foxes increased food quantity and quality for herbivores. Snow was similar to 4 times thicker in April on dens than controls, and 1.4 times thicker on dens with lemming nests than dens without, suggesting lemmings choose thicker snow for thermal insulation. Snow cover thickness was positively related to vegetation cover on dens, but not on control sites. Thus, Arctic foxes not only prey on lemmings but also engineer productive habitat that attracts lemmings. During winters with low lemming densities, when foxes often leave the denning area and predation risk is lower, fox dens may provide a refuge that could buffer the effects of deteriorating snow conditions with Arctic warming. This additional mechanism of predators interacting with their prey illustrates how ecosystem engineers potentially alter food web interactions and highlights the importance of integrating these bodies of theory in attempts to understand community dynamics."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Although the trade-off between allocation to clonal and sexual reproduction in clonal plants can be influenced by a variety of environmental factors, whether variations of reproductive allocation (RA) in response to different environments are driven only by a size-dependent effect (apparent plasticity) or whether RA can also change independently of plant size (true plasticity) is uncertain. We conducted an experiment in nine outdoor mesocosms (6400L) to investigate the response of clonal and sexual reproduction and vegetative growth of a perennial submerged macrophyte Vallisneria spinulosa at water depths of 50, 100, or 150cm. We evaluated size-dependent and size-independent effects of water depth on sexual and clonal RA. Deep water reduced vegetative size and sexual output (mass of fruits produced), but increased tuber production of V. spinulosa. There was an apparent trade-off between reproductive modes in terms of biomass investment; plants in deep water allocated more resources into clonal propagation and reduced investment in sexual reproduction compared to plants in shallow or intermediate water. Slopes of allometric relationships (sexual vs. vegetative biomass and clonal vs. vegetative biomass) were significantly affected by water depth. Shifts in sexual RA in response to varying water depths were largely size-dependent, but there were also size-independent effects. In contrast, size-independent effects were more important than effects of size changes in determining clonal RA. We concluded that V.spinulosa adapted to a water-depth gradient by plastic trade-offs between clonal propagation and sexual reproduction. Furthermore, a size-independent effect on RA suggests a flexible reproductive strategy that could be critical for plant performance in changing aquatic environments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

A. month = jan,",10.1002/ecs2.2075,,,,"Although landscape spatial structure is known to influence spatial patterns of biodiversity, its effect on insect communities at higher trophic levels such as parasitoids remains poorly understood. This is particularly true in continuously distributed forests in which it can be difficult to identify clear boundaries among habitat patches. Using the metacommunity framework, we evaluate the relative importance of forest landscape structure, non-environmental spatial structure, and host outbreak status to spatial and within-season temporal variation in parasitoid communities. We used variation partitioning and metacommunity structure analyses to identify (1) the drivers of the metacommunity structure of parasitoids associated with the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), and (2) how their relative influence varies through a season. We used a multi-scale perspective to summarize landscape heterogeneity in regions of increasing size around the community sampling locations. Spruce budworm larvae and pupae were sampled during three periods during the summer 2014 in 18 locations within continuous forest landscapes in Quebec, Canada. Thirty-two parasitoid wasp and fly species were recorded, 16 of which were found at more than one location. We found that the mechanisms shaping metacommunity structure changed over the course of a single season and that community structure varied among sites. At early and late periods in the season, we found that non-environmental structure, forest structure, and likely inter-specific competition were the main mechanisms influencing spatial variation in community structure. These results suggest a competition-dispersal trade-off. In contrast, at the middle period of the season, environmental filtering by forest structure and stochastic events were found to influence community structure. This period corresponds to the transition between early and late parasitoid communities. Our findings on the role of environmental filtering and forest structure support the idea that forest manipulations have the potential to influence parasitoid populations and hence spruce budworm outbreak dynamics as hypothesized by the enemies hypothesis. Moreover, our study highlights the value of considering a multi-scale approach and temporal variability of species interactions when characterizing the multiple processes shaping spatial metacommunity structure, particularly in continuous environments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Among tetrapods, birds have genomes that display many features that facilitate their assembly and annotation, such as small genome size, low number of repeats and highly conserved genomic structure. However, we found that high genomic heterozygosity could have a great impact on the quality of the genome assembly of the thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia), an arctic colonial seabird. In this study, we tested the performance of three genome assemblers, ray/sscape, soapdenovo2 and platanus, in assembling the highly heterozygous genome of the thick-billed murre. Our results show that platanus, an assembler specifically designed for heterozygous genomes, outperforms the other two approaches and produces a highly contiguous (N50 = 15.8Mb) and complete genome assembly (93\% presence of genes from the Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Ortholog [BUSCO] gene set). Additionally, we annotated the thick-billed murre genome using a homology-based approach that takes advantage of the genomic resources available for birds and other taxa. Our study will be useful for those researchers who are approaching assembly and annotation of highly heterozygous genomes, or genomes of species of conservation concern, and/or who have limited financial resources."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

The method aims to obtain data from a purposely selected group of individuals rather than from a statistically representative sample of a broader population. Even though the application of this method in conservation research has been extensive, there are no critical assessment of the application of the technique. In addition, there are no readily available guidelines for conservation researchers. Here, we reviewed the applications of focus group discussion within biodiversity and conservation research between 1996 and April 2017. We begin with a brief explanation of the technique for first-time users. We then discuss in detail the empirical applications of this technique in conservation based on a structured literature review (using Scopus). The screening process resulted in 170 articles, the majority of which (67\%, n=114,) were published between 2011 and 2017. Rarely was the method used as a stand-alone technique. The number of participants per focus group (where reported) ranged from 3 to 21 participants with a median of 10 participants. There were seven (median) focus group meetings per study. Focus group discussion sessions lasted for 90 (median) minutes. Four main themes emerged from the review: understanding of people's perspectives regarding conservation (32\%), followed by the assessment of conservation and livelihoods practices (21\%), examination of challenges and impacts of resource management interventions (19\%) and documenting the value of indigenous knowledge systems (16\%). Most of the studies were in Africa (n=76), followed by Asia (n=44), and Europe (n=30). We noted serious gaps in the reporting of the methodological details in the reviewed papers. More than half of the studies (n=101) did not report the sample size and group size (n=93), whereas 54 studies did not mention the number of focus group discussion sessions while reporting results. Rarely have the studies provided any information on the rationale for choosing the technique.

Identifying indices that reliably measure the functional diversity dimension(s) of interest requires careful testing of how each index responds to species' traits and abundance distributions. In the absence of a convenient simulation tool, tests with artificial data have to date explored only a limited number of scenarios or have altered trait and abundance distributions only indirectly based on principles of evolution and community assembly. We provide simul.comms, an R function that allows users to test the efficacy of functional diversity indices by easily creating artificial species communities with user-specified abundance and trait distributions for continuous, ordinal and categorical traits. To illustrate the function's utility, we examine the performance of R, a recently published abundance-sensitive index for functional redundancy. We use two approaches to designing simulation tests for this example analysis. The first uses simul.comms to create six separate sets of artificial communities to qualitatively assess how R responds to predictable changes in functional redundancy. The second uses simul.comms to independently alter seven community composition parameters, whose influence on R is then examined quantitatively via effect sizes in linear regression. Our analyses indicate that R broadly mirrors expected changes in functional redundancy and predictably responds to changes in community composition parameters. R appears, however, to primarily reflect trait distributions, responding minimally to variance in abundance and counter-intuitively to abundance range. Further refinement of tools to measure functional redundancy may therefore be desirable. The R tool we provide should assist with refining functional diversity measures, a critical step towards improving our ability to understand and mitigate the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. Because simul.comms simply produces two linked matrices, a species-by-traits matrix and a site-by-species abundance matrix, it may be equally valuable in exploring questions and analytical approaches in other areas of community ecology."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Here, we hypothesized that leaf anatomical traits were closely related to gross primary productivity (GPP) because photosynthesis commonly occurs in the chloroplasts of palisade and spongy tissues in leaf. Eight leaf anatomical traits were measured in 916 plant species inhabiting from tropical to cold-temperate forests in eastern China: adaxial epidermis thickness (AD), abaxial epidermis thickness (AB), leaf thickness (LT), palisade tissue thickness (PT), and spongy tissue thickness (ST), palisade-spongy tissue ratio (PT/ST), palisade tissue-leaf thickness ratio (PT/LT), and spongy tissue-leaf thickness ratio (ST/LT). Leaf anatomical traits showed significant latitudinal patterns at species, plant functional group (PFG), and community levels (p{\textless}.05), and they differed between PFG and community. Temperature and precipitation were the main factors influencing AD, AB, PT/ST, and PT/LT, explaining 33-72\% of the total variation at large scale. Furthermore, AB, LT, PT/ST, and PT/LT were significantly correlated with the aridity index. Our findings filled the data gap of plant anatomical traits at regional scales, and broadened current knowledge on the adaptation strategies of plant anatomical traits, which also provided new evidence for linkages of plant traits and functioning across natural communities.

In this study, we investigated GA and GN rates in nine forest soils along a 3,700-km north-south transect in eastern China. We used N-15-labelling techniques, along with field experiments and laboratory incubations, to assess in situ and potential rates of the GA and GN. The mean in situ GA rate was 4.90.5mg Nkg(-1)day(-1), whereas the mean potential rate of GA was 32.08.6mg Nkg(-1)day(-1). The mean in situ GN rate was 1.7 +/- 0.3mg Nkg(-1)day(-1) (potential GN rate: 3.2 +/- 0.6mg Nkg(-1)day(-1)). GA was significantly higher than GN along the transect, and there were high variations in GA and GN among different forests. Significant relationships were identified between meteorological factors (temperature and precipitation) and the GA and GN rates during the sampling month (August 2013). However, the mean GA rate in primary forest was significantly lower in the Huzhong (HZ), Dongling (DL), Taiyue (TY) and Dinghu (DH) sites compared with other sites, whereas with the exception of the Liangshui (LS) sampling site, the mean GN rate in primary and secondary forests showed the same trends. Significant differences in GA rates were found between primary and secondary forests at the LS and Changbai (CB) sites, and differences were detected in GN rate at the HZ, LS and Jiulian (JL) sites. Structural equation modelling analysis suggested that soil N contents, microbial biomass N pool sizes and bacterial abundance are the primary determinants of the in situ rates of GA and GN. The strong control of edaphic factors on GA and GN indicates a need to improve soil N models with more explicit representation of edaphic factors and their control on soil N transformations.

However, how facilitation via shrub-mediated nutrient increases varies with precipitation is poorly resolved. We first synthesized a global dataset from 66 studies and evaluated how shrubs affected soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in grasslands along a precipitation gradient. We then made new measurements in a single-grassland type encroached by leguminous shrubs from the same genus (Caragana) to constrain the variations caused by combining different grassland types and shrubs traits in the meta-analysis. Specifically, we investigated how shrubs mediated N dynamics and how shrub-grass interactions varied along a precipitation gradient (147-342mm) in a temperate steppe of China. At the global scale, leguminous shrub-mediated effects on soil nutrients increased with precipitation, while no relationship was found for non-leguminous shrub. For the field experiment, greater N and lower N-15 in Caragana compared to non-leguminous shrub (reference shrub, Salsola collina) suggested active N-fixation in Caragana. We found that Caragana enhanced N concentration and leaf quality (low C:N ratio) in neighbouring plants more on mesic sites than on xeric sites. Thus, facilitation increased via higher soil N and with decreasing environmental stress, at least along this relatively arid precipitation gradient. Our results highlight the importance of precipitation in determining the nutritional facilitation to neighbouring grasses from encroaching leguminous shrubs. Conceptual frameworks for plant facilitation may therefore need to include shrub characteristics (N-fixers vs. non-fixers) and positive effects of higher precipitation on this type of facilitation to characterize plant interactions along stress gradients.

Monoploid genome size was the only significant variable that clearly separated the North American native plants from those of European origin. The mean Cx value (the amount of DNA in one chromosome set) for source European native populations was 0.490 +/- 0.007 (mean +/- SD), for North American invasive 0.506 +/- 0.020, and for North American native 0.543 +/- 0.021. Relative to native populations, the European populations that successfully invaded North America had a smaller genome that was associated with plant traits favoring invasiveness (long rhizomes, early emerging abundant shoots, resistance to aphid attack, and low C:N ratio). The knowledge that invasive populations within species can be identified based on genome size can be applied to screen potentially invasive populations of Phragmites in other parts of the world where they could grow in mixed stands with native plants, as well as to other plant species with intraspecific variation in invasion potential. Moreover, as small genomes are better equipped to respond to extreme environmental conditions such as drought, the mechanism reported here may represent an emerging driver for future invasions and range expansions."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"

Mounting evidence shows that the functioning and stability of coastal ecosystems often depends critically on habitat-forming foundation species such as seagrasses, mangroves and saltmarsh grasses that engage in facultative mutualistic interactions. However, although restoration science is now gradually expanding its long-standing paradigm of minimizing competition to including intraspecific, or within species, facilitation in its designs, the potential of harnessing mutualistic interactions between species for restoration purposes remains uninvestigated. 2. Here, we experimentally tested whether a previously documented mutualism between marsh-forming Spartina alterniflora (cordgrass) and Geukensia demissa (mussels) can increase restoration success in degraded US saltmarshes. 3. We found that co-transplanted mussels locally increased nutrients and reduced sulphide stress, thereby increasing cordgrass growth and clonal expansion by 50\%. We then removed above-ground vegetation and mussels to simulate a disturbance event and discovered that cordgrass co-transplanted with mussels experienced three times greater survival than control transplants. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings indicate that mussels amplify cordgrass re-colonization and resilience over spatial and temporal scales that exceed those of their actual mutualistic interaction. By experimentally demonstrating that mutualistic partners can enable foundation species to overcome stress barriers to establish and persist, we highlight that coastal restoration needs to evolve beyond the sole inclusion of intraspecific-positive interactions. In particular, we suggest that integrating mutualisms in restoration designs may powerfully enhance long-term restoration success and ecosystem resilience in the many coastal ecosystems where mutualisms involving foundation species are important ecosystem-structuring interactions."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}"
